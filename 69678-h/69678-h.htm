  <h2 class='c006'>EDITOR’S PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Since the recent death of the noble woman whose
name has become a household word all over our
land, and whose memoirs form the subject of this
volume, I have been repeatedly importuned to give
to the public some account of her remarkable life.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is too soon yet to present an adequate biography,
and for such a task I should consider myself
entirely unfitted. I have, however, endeavored,
though somewhat hastily, to put together such material,
chiefly selections from newspaper reports,
letters, and diaries, as shall throw light upon the
numerous projects that were the outcome of her
thought and generosity, and which in certain ways
are unparalleled in the annals of those whose
wealth has been devoted to the cause of humanity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Cut off in the full ripeness of early womanhood,
her work was nevertheless accomplished, and millions
shall in the ages to come reap perennial harvests
from the seed which in one short year her
wisdom and foresight sowed far and wide.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>The world at large will know somewhat of her
work; but only to those who knew her best, to
whom she revealed the warmth and intensity of
her strong nature, can the full beauty of her life
be known.</p>

<p class='c005'>The constant, subtle charm of her manner, now
gracious and dignified, now unconsciously naive
and simple, only a master could portray. I must
content myself, therefore, with giving, in simplest
words, but a few of the many reminiscences that
memory brings back of those moments which may
serve to make clear the thoughts and purposes that
were the mainspring of all her action, and which
made her what she was, the noblest woman I have
ever known.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have hesitated about using the word “Memoirs”
in the title of this volume. That word has a
somewhat doleful and funereal sound, suggestive
of anything but the bright, vigorous life of her
who was so intensely warm and alive. But perhaps
there is no other word that so well expresses what
I have here put together, and so I leave it as I
wrote it first, “Memoirs of a Millionaire.”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The class of which I speak make themselves merry without
duties. They sit in decorated club-houses in the cities, and burn
tobacco and play whist; in the country they sit idle in stores and
bar-rooms, and burn tobacco, and gossip and sleep. They complain
of the flatness of American life; America has no illusions,
no romance. They have no perception of its destiny. They are
not Americans.—<span class='sc'>Emerson</span>, <cite>The Fortune of the Republic</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was on the evening of election day that I
first saw her. I had come up from Salem to
Boston, to spend the night and hear Booth and
Barrett the next day, and I had gone to dine at
aunt Madison’s on Louisburg Square.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lamps had not been lighted, and we were all
sitting cosily around the open grate after dinner,
talking over the <i><span lang="fr">matinée</span></i>, and jesting with two or
three of Will’s college friends who were there for
the evening, when the portière was noiselessly
drawn aside, and Mildred Brewster came in with a
cheery good evening.</p>

<p class='c005'>I can recall now just how she looked, as, after
the introductions were over, she stood leaning on
the back of aunt Madison’s chair, with the ruddy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>glow of the firelight on her face, and her lithe
figure dimly outlined against the shadowy background.</p>

<p class='c005'>I did not notice her much at first, for, after her
blithe greeting, on seeing strangers she had drawn
back into the shadow and sat so quietly that I,
carrying on a gay banter with the young men,
had almost forgotten her.</p>

<p class='c005'>I do not remember what was said at first. It
did not make much impression on me at the time,
until, after a while, the talk grew a little more
serious, and the young men began to speak of their
plans for the future. They were all seniors, and
each of them, except Will, had plenty of money
in his own right, with apparently nothing in life
more burdensome to do than to draw checks and
order dinners at Young’s.</p>

<p class='c005'>They were a handsome trio, broad-chested, keen-eyed,
clad in the daintiest of linen from Noyes
Brothers,—“the jolliest swells in the class,” Will
called them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Aunt Madison asked them, apropos of the election,
how they had voted, for they were all residents
of Boston and had passed their majority.
They were evidently rather amused at the query,
but each and all politely replied that they hadn’t
much enthusiasm about voting, and it having been
a rainy day, they had not taken the trouble to go
to the polls.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You see, the fact is,” said the young man with
the blonde mustache whom Will called Ned Conro,
“voting is a confounded bore, any way.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>“But of course you have an interest in national
politics, if not in municipal affairs?” said aunt
Madison, inquiringly, as she looked up from her
knitting and beamed benevolently at the young
man through her gold-bowed spectacles. “I suppose
you young men at Harvard, with all your
study of history and political economy, are wide
awake about all these things.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, we talk free trade and protection more or
less, that is, the fellows did who took that course
of study last year. I don’t go in for that sort of
thing myself very much; my money isn’t in manufactures,
and I don’t care a continental about the
tariff one way or the other. And as for politics,—of
course we all go in for the hurrah and fun in
a presidential campaign, but I don’t look forward
to doing anything further in that line after I graduate.
It is all well enough for any one who has a
fancy for it and who wants to run for office, and
that sort of thing. But there can’t be more than
two senators and one governor in a state at a time,
and anything less than that isn’t worth the trouble.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve mighty little respect for any man who
condescends to be a ward politician. Boston is an
Irish city, after all, though last year some of the
better class got their blood up and had a clearing
out; but the game isn’t worth the candle, and I,
for one, am willing to let the Irish go the whole
figure if they wish to do it. We can’t get rid of
them, and it doesn’t pay to mix up with them. I
don’t propose to vote to have my father, or any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>other gentleman of good old New England stock,
sit beside some liquor-seller or grocer as common
councilman or alderman.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Neither do I,” ejaculated my <i><span lang="fr">vis-à-vis</span></i>, whom
Will had introduced as Mr. Mather; “a fellow
who begins to bother his head about all these little
twopenny municipal affairs only soils his hands
for his pains, and doesn’t improve matters one
atom. It’s well enough to vote if one wants to,
but what does a single vote amount to? It counts
no more when cast by a Harvard professor than by
some South Cove ‘Mick.’ Suppose Mr. Smith and
Mr. Brown are up for school committee; you don’t
know a thing about either of them, except that
they are nominated by a set of rummies and demagogues,
or else by a lot of women or pious temperance
cranks. You are a professional man and
your time is worth ten dollars an hour,—you
don’t care a fig about the whole school committee
business anyway; it’s the women’s affair—they
can vote on that. Let them turn out and manage
it as they did last year, if they want to; but you
can’t expect a man to look after these matters, and
be elbowed and hooted down at the caucuses, if he
has the tastes of a gentleman and all the responsibilities
of a profession or a large business on his
shoulders.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The fact is that in municipal matters the ballot
ought to be put on a property basis, and until
that is done, I shall bother myself precious little
about it,” remarked the third young gentleman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>twirling his seal and addressing his three feminine
listeners.</p>

<p class='c005'>I wondered why Mildred’s cheeks had grown so
rosy and why her dark eyes had such a gleam in
them as she laid down the bit of embroidery on
which her fingers had been busy, and turned toward
the speaker. “What a profile!” I thought;
“almost pure Greek, only the chin is a little too
square.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The truth is,” the young man continued, “we
have no great men now and no great issues, unless
you call all this frenzy about the school question a
great issue. We’ve got to come to see that the
government has no right to tax its citizens to teach
history, anyway. It’s an imposition to tax a man
to send some one else’s child to a high school. Let
the state give a child the three R’s, and then if
he wants to learn about Tetzel or Luther, let his
father pay to have him taught in his own way.
Politics is no profession for a young man. There’s
no great amount of money in it, unless you’re
mighty shrewd, and tricky, too; and as for fame,
the man must be pretty thick-skinned who can
stand the pelting which every reputation gets nowadays,
and not wince under it. For my part, I
think democracy is a good deal played out. It
was all right so long as men <em>were</em> equal; but
we’re getting about as stratified a society now as
there is anywhere in the Old World; and there’s
no use in the sentimental every-man-a-brother kind
of talk. I don’t propose to shake the greasy hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>of any of these beastly foreigners that are coming
here and crowding us to the wall. I don’t grudge
them the rights of American citizenship; they
may have it and welcome, if they want it; but
where they step in I step out. In fact, I think I
shall settle down in Paris or Florence for a while.
There’s lots more fun for a fellow over there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was more of this sort of talk. I watched
Mildred’s face, and noticed that her lips were
twitching and her fingers playing nervously with
the fringe of a scarlet silk shawl which she wore.
Evidently she was under some stress of strong
emotion, though for what reason I but vaguely
guessed. She had come out of the shadow, and
stood tall and stately, with her arm resting on the
mantel and her eyes fixed on the speakers with
such a look as I had never before seen on any
countenance. There was anger and pity and contempt,
strangely mingled, on her mobile features.
She had forgotten herself, and I think they were
fairly startled at the look they read in her tell-tale
face.</p>

<p class='c005'>Will made an attempt to change the subject,
but Mr. Mather broke in: “You look as though
you did not agree with us, Miss Brewster. Come,
we have monopolized the conversation so far, now
tell us what <em>you</em> think.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She did not speak at first, and there was an
awkward silence for a minute. When it was
broken, her voice sounded so painfully hard and
calm in its effort not to tremble that I scarcely
recognized it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“Within two weeks,” she said, speaking slowly,
“I have sat for five hours face to face with the
leading anarchists of New England. I have questioned
them, and they have told me frankly of
their doctrines, which you already know, and
which, I scarcely need to say, I heartily detest.
But I have not heard, either from the lips of these
misguided men or from any one for many months,
anything which has so shocked and surprised me
as what I have just listened to here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I felt that she was trembling as she spoke, but
her voice was low and quiet.</p>

<p class='c005'>She continued: “When one is filled with indignation
and grief it is difficult to speak justly and
wisely, and therefore, if you will excuse me, I think
that I will not trust myself to say anything further.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good heavens!” cried Mr. Mather, staring at
her in undisguised amazement, while his companions
glanced slyly at each other with faint smiles
and an evident endeavor to make the best of an
embarrassing situation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think, dear, you had better tell them what
you are thinking of, lest they misunderstand you;
of course you don’t mean that they are worse than
anarchists,” said aunt Madison, gently.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, not worse, but more to blame,” replied
Miss Brewster, with extraordinary candor, and
then recollecting herself, a crimson tide suddenly
mantled her neck and cheek and brow, and she
drew back again into the shadow.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“I beg your pardon,” she stammered; and then
with a little forced laugh she added, “you see, you
oughtn’t to have tempted me to speak. I was sure
to give offense if I spoke my thoughts.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, but we can’t excuse you unless you go on,”
said Ned Conro, persuasively. “As for me, you
have whetted my curiosity so that I shan’t sleep a
wink to-night,” he went on, with a twinkle in his
eye, “unless I know why my father’s son and heir,
who has hitherto supposed himself to be always on
the side of law and order, is more to blame than
these foreign wretches who have come over here
with the notion in their addled heads that they are
going to upset this nineteenth-century civilization
with a few ounces of dynamite.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Gordon echoed Mr. Conro’s request, while a
quizzical smile played around his lips, and I knew
as well as if he had told me, that he was saying to
himself, “Gad, she’s a specimen! One of these
cranky women’s-righters, no doubt. How they do
like to hold forth! These girls always spoil a fellow’s
fun with their high and mighty theories and
ideas.” And this son of a quadruple millionaire
thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his English
trousers and stretched himself comfortably to
listen, with all the complacent condescension of a
man to whom twenty-two years of experience and
masculine wisdom gave a consciousness of virtuous
superiority.</p>

<p class='c005'>The flush had faded from Mildred’s cheek, but I
fancied from the look in her eyes that she was in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>no mood to be trifled with; this was no mere passing
gust of passion. She had received a wound
which had cut her to the quick; for, as I afterwards
learned to know, hers was one of those rare natures,
rare in men, rarer still in women, which scarcely
feels a personal slight, but to which a grand, absorbing
idea is more real and vital than all else,
and which counts treason to this the unpardonable
sin.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If I speak, I must speak plainly,” said Mildred.
“I have neither time nor wit to clothe my
thoughts in ambiguous, inoffensive words. Like
plain, blunt Antony, I can only ‘speak right on’
and say ‘what in my heart doth beat and burn.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good, I like that,” said Mr. Mather gravely,
and there was an instant’s silence, broken only by
the chime of the cathedral clock as it struck the
hour.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have been thinking,” said Mildred quietly,
“of those words in that record of the young Hebrew,
who, it is said, sold his birthright for a mess
of pottage. I have been thinking also of those
words of our own Emerson: ‘We live in a new
and exceptional age. America is another name
for Opportunity. Our whole history appears like
a last effort of Providence in behalf of the human
race.’ Perhaps you do not see the connection between
these two thoughts, but to me it seems very
close. To have for one’s inheritance the birthright
of American citizenship seems to me something so
rich and precious that to despise it and ignobly sell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>it,—not like Esau for the mess of pottage which
could relieve his hunger,—but to sell it to the
stranger for the sake of gaining immunity from
responsibility, yes, more than that, throwing it
away out of sheer contempt for it and ingratitude
for what it has done for one, this seems to me the
acme of cowardice and selfishness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I noticed that Mr. Mather knit his brows at this,
and I thought I detected a slight flush in his
cheeks, but perhaps it was only the firelight. Mildred
did not look up or hesitate, but went steadily
on.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, they won it, not we; and we, the heirs of
all the ages, for whom the whole creation has
groaned and travailed until now, we, the favored
children of the best age, the best land which history
has known, we idly fold our hands and let the
wealth of all the past, which others have toiled for
and shed bloody sweat to gain, fall into our laps as
a matter of course, as if it were but the just due of
such lordly creatures as we.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of what value, pray, is all our study of history
if we have so little realizing sense of its meaning,
if we have no imagination to fill out with quivering,
throbbing life this record of the past, which shows
what mankind has been, and what, thank God, we
have escaped?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“Of what value are the sacrifices of those who
at bitter cost bought us our freedom and privilege,
if we are so lost to all sense of honor as to tacitly
say, ‘everything has been done for us, to be sure,
but we can’t be expected to go out of our way to
see that it is passed along to those who are less
favored’?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Mather made a gesture of dissent and looked
up as if to speak; but Mildred did not notice him.
She was gazing with fixed eyes into the shadows,
and seemed to have forgotten her little audience
and to be addressing herself to an unnumbered
throng of unseen listeners. Her bosom heaved and
her breath came and went quickly as she went on
with her relentless sarcasm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, our business as immortal sons of God is
first of all to look out for our precious selves. Let
us all see to it that no annoying social or economic
questions shall disturb our minds. Let us not be
distracted from our culture and amusements by
being forced to waste time in settling the prosaic
bread and butter problems of the ‘lower classes.’
Let us wash our hands of all responsibility. Why
should we hold ourselves debtors either to the
Greeks or to the barbarians?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, we are not hard-hearted. We would live
and let live. But we can count it no part of our
business to soil our fingers by lending a hand to
the poor wretch whose blind guide has led him into
the miry ditch.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let him who ‘despises his birthright’ just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>think for an instant what citizenship on the continent
of Europe means. You talk about finding
‘more fun’ in Paris and Vienna than here, yes, to
be sure; for there you have nothing to do but
to skim the cream of everything and dream away
your youth surrounded by all that the thought of
the ages and modern science can devise to stimulate
your already fastidious palate. But suppose
you were a <em>citizen</em> of Germany or Austria or Russia,
and must spend from three to six of the best
years of your life in active service in the army;
suppose you were taxed to the extent of over thirty
per cent. of your earnings like the people of Italy;
suppose you knew that your country was growing
poorer and taxation was on the frightful increase
as is the case in continental countries; suppose you
were taxed to support a church in which you did
not believe, and a government which granted you
no representation; suppose privilege and prejudice
hung like a millstone round every effort for your
social advancement!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why,” continued Mildred after a moment’s
pause, “just imagine for an instant all that is involved
in the difference in comfort and mode of life
from the simple statement that during the ten years
from 1870 to 1880, when the United States decreased
its aggregate taxation nine per cent., Germany
increased hers over fifty per cent. Imagine,
if you can, what it means to the lives of millions
of human beings when I say that during a period
when the wealth of Europe decreased per caput
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>three per cent. that of our country increased nearly
forty per cent.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is one thing, I have found, to travel in Europe
untaxed, unmolested, and unaffected by that
gloomy war cloud which continually hovers over
every nation; where, even in times of peace, one
man out of twenty-two is withdrawn from productive
industries to train himself to destroy his fellow-beings.
It is quite another thing to be an irresponsible
traveler, free to come and go and say
what he pleases.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let those who count their American citizenship
of such slight worth think what a delightful
existence theirs would be if they were so favored
as to be one of the subjects of the Russian Tsar!
Think of the bliss of living in a land where one
is never disturbed by the encroachments of foreigners,
or expected to attend caucuses and polls;
where, in fact, the less he knows about the government
the better for him and his! Fancy the pleasure
in reading newspapers where the news of the
day is under such careful surveillance, through the
kindness of the censorship, that one is never disturbed
by troublesome political matters, and has
always the calm consciousness that everything is
going well, although ninety per cent. of the hundred
millions over whom the Russian flag waves
cannot write their names; where a man may not go
from one town to another without a passport;
where for joining a club that advocates a constitutional
monarchy, as here you might join a club that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>advocates Nationalism, you may be subject without
a moment’s warning to arrest and solitary confinement
for a year or two without a trial! You have
read Kennan and Stepniak. You know these are
hard facts.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So when I see men who have been ground between
the millstones of caste, priestcraft, and governmental
oppression come here and turn against
all government, I have less contempt and more patience
for them than for the young men of our land,
who owe almost every blessing that they enjoy to
this government, and who from mere indolence and
apathy choose to allow the demagogue and ignorant
alien to shape its destiny.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You complain that we have a ‘stratified society.’
Are you not doing your best to make it a
stratified society and create a caste system when
you advocate a property qualification for the ballot,
and would deny all but the barest rudiments of
education to the poor boy? One would think that
you had been brought up in a monarchy and did
not realize that from the people we must choose
our legislators as well as our voters, and that a
system which can be tolerated in a country where
rulers are hereditary is most perilous for a government
that is of ‘the people, by the people, and for
the people.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“You say ‘there are no great men now,’ ‘no
great issues.’ True, the war is over, and Grant and
Lincoln are dead, but</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>‘Life may be given in many ways,</div>
      <div class='line'>And loyalty to truth be sealed</div>
      <div class='line'>As bravely in the closet as in the field,</div>
      <div class='line'>So bountiful is fate.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“I do not doubt if our flag were openly dishonored
you, too, would spring to arms and give
your life-blood as heroically as those who fell at
Manassas or in the Wilderness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But how many young men have that kind of
heroism that impels them to devote their culture
and ability to unostentatious, unceasing service to
the state, though it bring no glory or reward in
fame or office? No, the cowards are not so often
to be found on the battlefield as at the committee
meeting and the caucus.</p>

<p class='c005'>“True, there seems to be nothing sublime in
being a faithful health commissioner, an Anthony
Comstock, a General Armstrong, or a Felix Adler;
nothing glorious in busying one’s self with such
prosy things as labor statistics and tenement
houses, with prison reform and sewage and primary
schools and ward politics. ’Tis a thankless
task, and the large per cent. of our Boston legal
voters who did not vote yesterday doubtless think,
if they think at all, that even the casting of a
ballot once or twice a year is too great a sacrifice
of their valuable time, and more than ought to
be expected of men whose private and social interests
are of far more importance than the welfare
of the body politic.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And as for caucuses, how preposterous to expect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>a man who has such important matters as Art
Club receptions, Psychical Research meetings, and
Longwood toboggan parties to attend, to spend one
or two evenings a year in the company of grocers
and saloon-keepers, all for the sake of defeating
some lamplighter or pawnbroker who wants a nomination
for the city council! What difference does
it make who is on the council, provided taxes are
not raised?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” continued Mildred, and a shade of melancholy
replaced the quiet scorn in her tone, “the
last thing that you or they ever dream of is that
you have a debt to pay and are basely repudiating
it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The voice, whose tremor at last betrayed the intensity
of the feeling that had hitherto been carefully
guarded, ceased, and suddenly starting with
a self-conscious look, and coloring deeply, Mildred
glided softly from the room. Aunt Madison followed
her.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fire had burned low and the light was dim.
The young men had forgotten me in the sofa
corner.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was not a word said for a minute or two
as they sat looking into the bed of coals and listening
to the wind shuddering through the bare
branches of the elms outside. Mr. Mather sat
leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and
his head on his hands; I could not see his face.
Presently he looked up and made a motion as if to
speak, but apparently he changed his mind, for he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>said nothing. At last Mr. Gordon’s voice broke
the silence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I say, Madison,” he asked, with a studiously
polite manner, “who is this charming Miss Brewster
who has favored us with the benefit of her
views?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She is a sort of second cousin of my mother,”
Will replied. “She has just returned from abroad,
and I haven’t seen much of her yet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” rejoined the other, “with your permission,
I will venture to say that with all due respect
to your mother’s second or third cousin, I would
as lief hear it thunder as to hear her talk. Why
can’t a pretty woman let well enough alone and not
go into hysterics over what she doesn’t know anything
about? You would think, to hear her go
on, that the country was going to the devil, and
that we were the cause of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wonder if all those facts about Russia and
the thirty per cent. taxation in Italy are really
true,” interposed Mr. Conro, meditatively. “She
reeled off all those statistics like a schoolma’am
saying dates.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They are true if she says so, you can bet your
life on that,” answered Will, thoroughly nettled.
“Being out at Cambridge most of the time, I
haven’t seen much of her, and I never heard her
say so much on any subject before to-night. I
was about as much surprised as you were at her
coming out in that way; but if you and Gordon
think she is the kind of girl to go into hysterics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>over nothing, you are mightily mistaken. Most
people talk for the sake of talking, but I’ve seen
enough of her to know that when she says a thing
it stands for something. What you said hurt her
in a way a fellow like you can’t understand. You’ve
no interest in a girl who has any notions beyond
flattering you into thinking you are the most stunning
fellow going.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Beg pardon,” drawled Gordon, “but”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hold on there,” interposed Mr. Mather, grimly;
“you’ve said enough. What she said was solid
gospel, and you know it as well as I do.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jessie dear</span>,—I have been sitting for the last
half hour in the broad, cushioned window-seat of
my cosy attic room, looking far out over the mass
of chimney-tops to the towers and spires beyond
the hill and the Public Garden.</p>

<p class='c005'>I love to sit here quietly on Sunday afternoons,
and when the sunset comes I throw aside my books
and watch the shifting, brilliant colors turning the
blue Charles into a sheet of glimmering gold and
dyeing with rosy hues the snowy slopes of Corey
Hill beyond.</p>

<p class='c005'>Have you been away so long as to have forgotten
these dear old sights? And do you recall that
on this western slope of Beacon Hill from which
I write to you lived the hermit Blackstone of
Shawmut, before Winthrop or any Puritan had
thought of settling Boston town?</p>

<p class='c005'>I like old places. I like to be on the oldest spot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>in this old, historic town, as you may easily imagine,
remembering all my antiquarian enthusiasm
when we were at school. Well, I have not outgrown
it in the least, in spite of all my modern
radicalism about many things.</p>

<p class='c005'>I wonder, dear, what all these ten years have
brought to you. I have been sitting and thinking,
as the sunset glow has faded in the western
sky, all its glory turning so soon to dull, cold gray,
how in these few minutes the past years seem
typified. What glorious visions, what radiant
achievements illumined the heavens when we
looked at them with the eyes of eighteen! What
would we not, what could we not, dream of doing
then? I remember how you vowed that I was a
genius, and were sure that ten years would not pass
before I should win renown. And now, to-night,
on my twenty-eighth birthday, I sit here as dull
and prosy and commonplace a spinster as one can
well find in this city of spinsters.</p>

<p class='c005'>After one is twenty-five and the birthdays begin
to be a little unwelcome, I suppose one is apt to be
made a little morbid by them, though I solace myself
by thinking that since college girls in these
days rarely finish their studies before twenty-two,
twenty-eight does not seem so ancient as it was
once thought to be.</p>

<p class='c005'>How strange that we should have known so
little of each other, we who vowed that “ocean-sundered
continents” should never make our girlhood’s
love less warm! But after your change of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>name and transfer to the China Mission, while I
was at Smith College, I lost sight of you, and, missing
your letters, knew not where to write. So you
will understand my long silence and know that the
Mildred of ten years ago is the same Mildred to-day,
only no longer a girl, but a woman.</p>

<p class='c005'>A woman, with many ambitions unsatisfied, with
many heroes dethroned, but with the same loves
and hopes and fears, and with the same ideals, although
their attainment seems farther off with the
growing years.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have slowly come to recognize and be reconciled
to my mediocrity; to know that I have not had
a thought but has been common to humanity; that
I am no whit wiser or better than all my fellows;
and that what you in girlish enthusiasm flattered
me into believing was creative power was simply a
capacity to appreciate and be moved by what was
great.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have longed for power, but, believe me, not for
name or fame. Simply to have had the consciousness
in myself that the world was better and wiser
for my having lived would have made all drudgery
and toil a joy and privilege. But the blessedness
of giving and doing in a large measure has not
been granted to me. Not that I blame fate or
circumstance or environment. I have had health
and freedom and friends; no hindrances and no
great sorrows since mother left me alone five years
ago.</p>

<p class='c005'>The failure lies with myself alone. Sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>there has been an unutterable loneliness and a
longing for something, I know not what; but I
suppose it must be for the love which has not yet
come to me, and which now may never come.</p>

<p class='c005'>But I do not let that burden me overmuch. I
have my daily task. I love my work; and here,
among my books, I thankfully count myself rich
indeed in the society of all the great and wise and
good of whose treasures I am the happy heir. I
have traveled, too, and seen the Old World cities
and the castles, palaces, and ruins of which we used
to dream. It was not exactly the blissful experience
I had fancied, for I was doomed to be the
companion of a stupid old dowager whose money
bought my time and service, and to whom I was
useful as an interpreter of the arts and languages
with which she was unfamiliar.</p>

<p class='c005'>I saw a great deal and learned some things. It
helped me a little towards reaching that goal of
culture at which I aim, whence I can truly say
that “I count nothing human foreign to me.” It
helped to free me somewhat from the narrowness
of my age and environment. I have become a
little more of a Greek, a little less of a rugged
Goth. Not that mere travel did this; if my eyes
had not begun to be opened before, I should have
seen nothing. I have verified nothing more
thoroughly than Emerson’s saying, “Though we
travel the world over to find the beautiful we must
carry it with us or we find it not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I miss the picturesqueness and the charm of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Old World life. I am surprised to find how shocked
and annoyed I am at the crudities and Philistinism
of which I was once oblivious. But, after all, I am
glad to be back; glad to be in the current of real
life again, and to take my share in it. It is worth
something to live in a land where one does not
have to despise the men or pity the women; where
a man is not ashamed to be seen carrying his own
baby; where a girl can walk the streets alone and
unmolested, and where a lady can earn her daily
bread and be thought a lady still.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have a quiet home with my mother’s cousin—“auntie,”
I call her; and I have settled down to
steady work with a concert or play or toboggan
party to give it a little zest now and then. My
classes take me to Dorchester and Cambridge and
Longwood. Once a week I meet a score or so of
our Boston society women in a Commonwealth
Avenue drawing-room, who manage, among their
thousand and one lectures, lessons, and engagements
of every sort, to squeeze in an hour to hear
me discourse on the topics of the day, when I try
to teach them about some phases of our nineteenth
century life of which they, like most women, know
but little. As these ladies include all shades of
religious and political belief and non-belief, I have
to choose my words, as you may imagine.</p>

<p class='c005'>I write a little occasionally for the “Transcript”
or “Woman’s Journal,” or some other equally inoffensive
and unremunerative sheet. I visit my North
Enders, and think I am doing God more service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>in trying to keep some of my small Hibernians
from being sent to the Reform School than I ever
used to accomplish in teaching Jewish history at
the Mission.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have given up Sunday-school work. Not that
I disbelieve in it, but I find myself less and less
able to adapt myself to the requirements of superintendents
and “lesson helps,” and my conscience
now forbids me to teach what I could once repeat
so glibly and confidently.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yes, let me say it frankly,—though I fear it
will greatly shock you, you dear, pious soul,—I
have gone over to the “New Theology,” and I
have gone so far and so irrevocably that but few
of those churches where my childhood’s faith is
still believed dare open their doors to me.</p>

<p class='c005'>I wonder if you can conceive how painful it
has been to me to find the friends for whom I care
most condemning as irreligious every thoughtful
man or woman who ventures to treat the Hebrew
scriptures in a reasonable way.</p>

<p class='c005'>My last Sunday-school class was in the home
school, where I had bright girls of sixteen. I did
my best to make the Bible a living book to them,
to make them study the history of the Jews in
the same natural and enthusiastic way that they
studied their Greek history at school, but I soon
found that they considered this sacrilegious. They
looked at me with cold, critical glances when I
tried to spiritualize their “Gates Ajar” idea of
heaven. I found that they had gone home and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>told their mothers that I did not believe in God or
heaven or hell, and, to my bitter mortification and
dismay, they left me one by one until I was alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doubtless I had little wisdom. I was trying to
teach them in a few months what it had taken me
years of growth to reach. In trying to disabuse
them of their anthropomorphic notions of God, I
had succeeded in making Him only a nonentity to
them. In taking away a literal Garden of Eden
and the serpent, and substituting a theory of evolution,
I had, in their imaginations, abolished all inspiration
and moral responsibility. Not that they
were girls who troubled themselves very much
about such things; they could dance and flirt as
well as the best; but as for really daring to face
the evidence on such matters, that was wicked and
dangerous, in their opinion.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nor was this all. One good old clergyman, to
whose church I brought a letter of recommendation,
and who after my candid talk felt obliged to
deny me a welcome, said, with tears in his eyes,
that he hoped my mother’s prayers would save me.</p>

<p class='c005'>It made me feel forlorn and homesick for a
while. I like the strength, sincerity, and earnestness
which the old faith gave, and I cannot lightly
break away from it. I hate the lukewarmness and
apathy of many of the more radical faith, and I
cannot make up my mind to cast my lot with them.
Besides, I have a half fear that, after all, they
have not begun, even intellectually, to probe to the
bottom these great historic beliefs on which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>church has stood for ages. I fear that they treat
them too cavalierly, too superficially. I find about
as much intolerance among the so-called liberals
as among the conservatives.</p>

<p class='c005'>To me sin is not an ailment to be cured with
sugared plums. The Puritanism in me rebels at
the weakness and flabbiness of many who have left
the old faith for a broader one. However much my
mind is forced to accept their doctrine, my sympathies
abide with the men of moral earnestness who
still think it their business to be “saving souls.”</p>

<p class='c005'>To me the doctrine of the Trinity is something
more than a mathematical absurdity, as the men of
one party say; and, on the other hand, something
more than an inscrutable mystery to be accepted
without deep philosophic study, as the men of the
other party hold.</p>

<p class='c005'>I pity and long to help the poor souls groping
for some solution of the religious problems peculiar
to our day. There are thousands of them—more
than any one knows—inside the fold of the church
itself, fed, but not nourished, and famishing for
the kind of food which their good pastors know
not how to give.</p>

<p class='c005'>How many times I have gone to church bewildered,
utterly wretched, my soul crying out for the
living God, and listened to a cheap, well-meant discourse
against “Ingersoll, Emerson, and all other
unbelievers in the inspired Word of God,” with an
earnest exhortation to refrain at our peril from
“searching into what are the hidden mysteries.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>I understood the preacher’s standpoint, poor
soul! I respected him and his effort, but oh, how
helpless he was to do anything for me who could
detect the sophistry and lack of discrimination in
all this talk!</p>

<p class='c005'>Oh, if I could help those who have been driven to
question the whole of truth, when they thus find out
a part of it to have been crude or false! And I
pity almost as much the many timid ones who, like
myself, are longing to stay in the mother church,
to that end being sorely tempted to quibble with
creeds, but who find no place either in or out of
the church which would exactly express their true
religious attitude.</p>

<p class='c005'>How strange all this must seem to you, who used
to feel that heaven and earth might fall, but that I
should never give up my faith.</p>

<p class='c005'>No, please God, I shall never give up faith, nor
hold less faithfully to the eternal verities which
alone make life worth living. Never have I felt
more deeply than to-day the truth of the old words
of the catechism, “Man’s chief end is to glorify
God and enjoy him forever.” But I do not hold
that keeping the faith is an adherence to any creed
or an absolute acceptance of any book, even if it
be the Book of books.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have come to feel that the teaching of my
childhood which made historic facts, or what were
assumed to be historic facts, of equal importance
with the eternal and immutable laws of moral and
spiritual growth,—I have come, I say, to feel that
his was false. Ah me, the pity of it!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>I write you all this because I want you to
know the strongest reason that has prevented me
from following in your footsteps and, as I once
dreamed of doing, giving myself up either at home
or abroad to the grand missionary work which
still seems to me the most satisfying kind of work
in the world. No, I cannot be a missionary; I
think I shall never dare to teach any one; I don’t
know how; but, thank God, I have come to see a
little more clearly some truths to which I think
it is possible for the human mind to attain. The
vision thus gained, though still at times a fleeting
one, has, I firmly believe, placed me forever beyond
the reach of the nightmare of doubts and mortal
terrors which first assailed me after I dared trust
myself to think and question.</p>

<p class='c005'>No one, not bred in a New England home with
all the Puritan traditions imbibed with every
breath, can realize the fever and despair that I have
felt more than once after I dared to think and face
the result of my thought. But that torture can
never come again. Not that I have relapsed into
indifference or have heeded the pleadings of my
devout friends to “only believe,” that so I might
dread my doubts as impious and accept without
question the creed of my fathers. No! Kant,
Hegel, and Fichte, Carlyle and Emerson, Robertson,
Stanley, Phillips Brooks, and, more than all,
the unprejudiced study of the Bible itself, have
kept me from that.</p>

<p class='c005'>I no longer tremble at the question whether the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>record of the miracles be fact or no; it touches not
my spiritual life. The baby born next door yesterday
is a greater miracle to me than Lazarus raised
from the dead; the morning’s breakfast turned into
vital force that guides this hand as marvelous as
water changed to wine. Whether the resurrection
of Jesus be literal fact or not, it in no wise affects
my immortality. My faith rests on something surer
than the accuracy of any historic fact.</p>

<p class='c005'>Are you shocked? Yes, doubtless, for so should
I have been once. I do not expect you to understand
me yet, unless you too have been climbing up
to the light by the same path in which I have been
led. You will think that I have been venturing on
dangerous ground, but I could not write to you
without granting your request to tell you how it
was with me in my inmost self.</p>

<p class='c005'>You ask whether I am married or am going to
be. The first question I have answered; as to the
second, the most that I can say is that when a
woman has lived a dozen years beyond sweet sixteen
and has never been very deeply in love, it
argues either that she has lived like a nun, or
something rather uncomplimentary to her heart,
and that there is precious little prospect of her
ever finding the right one after that.</p>

<p class='c005'>They say no woman ever fails of some time having
at least one suitor. Well, I have had my one.
A burly, broad-chested business man he was, with
very decided ideas about protection and mining
stock, with a good deal of amused wonder at my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>independence of thought and action, and a chivalrous
old-fashioned pity for gentlewomen who had
to earn their living. He felt pretty desperately
when I said “no,” and I had to say it three or four
times before he could believe it, for he had been so
sure that a poor young creature like me must long
for his strong arm and good bank account to shield
her from the “world’s cold blasts.” I did like
him, I confess, but not enough; not as I must
love the one to whom I would gladly, heartily,
pledge my whole self for life.</p>

<p class='c005'>So, one bright spring day he sailed away for
South America and never returned. He married
a Spanish wife, I hear, who will inherit his millions,
for he made shrewd investments and became enormously
wealthy. The “Herald” had a dispatch
yesterday morning announcing his death from sunstroke.
It gave me a shock. Yes, he was a good
man, and I did like him; but I am glad I am not
his widow in spite of his millions.</p>

<p class='c005'>We were talking at lunch to-day about wealth,
and when I answered the question “How much
money would you wish for if you could have your
wish?” by saying “Twenty-five millions,” every
one looked aghast.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What, <em>you</em>, Mildred, of all persons! Why,
you never cared for diamonds or horses or yachts
or anything grand,” exclaimed one.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What in the world would you do with it?”
asked another. “You couldn’t spend half a million
with your modest tastes, and the rest would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>simply a dead weight. You would be bored to
death with lawyers and beggars, and have brain
fever in six weeks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh no,” interposed a third; “she would buy
shoes for all the barefoot children, and build colleges
from Alaska to Key West.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you were like most people you would find it
the hardest thing in the world to spend your
money wisely,” said auntie, sagely.</p>

<p class='c005'>So I kept my counsel and said nothing. I can’t
help wishing, though, to know what will become of
these millions which I might have had by saying
that one little word five years ago. It seems to me
I should not be utterly at a loss to find some wise
uses for them, and it would not be by building colleges
which are not needed, or by encouraging pauperism....</p>

<p class='c011'>MILDRED’S MILLIONS.—BOSTON’S BEAUTIFUL BELLE
FALLS HEIRESS TO A FORTUNE ESTIMATED AT
THIRTY MILLIONS! MISS MILDRED BREWSTER
THE SOLE HEIRESS.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the rumor in yesterday’s South American
despatches hinted that the colossal fortune amassed
by the late Mr. William Dunreath was, according
to his will, to be transferred <i><span lang="la">in toto</span></i> to a Boston
lady, when moreover, on investigation, the name
of the aforesaid lady was disclosed by her lawyer,
an enterprising representative of the “Herald”
was not long in finding his way to the residence of
this favored daughter of fortune.</p>

<p class='c005'>Two other journalists, with pencil and pad in
readiness, arrived almost simultaneously and were
shown into the reception room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Brewster was out.</p>

<p class='c005'>Would her ladyship soon return?</p>

<p class='c005'>That was doubtful.</p>

<p class='c005'>A skillful use of some of Uncle Sam’s coin, however,
secured an “aside” in the library with the
sable domestic whose acquaintance with desirable
facts proved a godsend.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Was Miss Brewster young?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Certainly. She had just celebrated her twenty-fourth
birthday, or, to quote our informant more
literally, “Yes, sah, she is done gone twenty-fo’
shuah, fo’ I made her buffday cake.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Was Miss Brewster handsome?”</p>

<p class='c005'>In response to this momentous question this jewel
of a Chloe produced from a corner of the library
a photograph album containing two cabinet photographs,
taken in Boston and Paris respectively,
and representing one of the most attractive types
of petite female beauty. One picture was taken in
a jaunty riding habit, displaying to good advantage
a slender, trim figure, with a graceful poise to a
very pretty head, and a pair of fascinating dark
eyes looking frankly at you from under the hat-brim.
The other was in a white evening dress
modestly covering the sloping shoulders, the hair
worn Pompadour, and no ornaments save flowers.
There was a delicacy and refinement indicated in
the small ear and sensitive mouth, which betokened
generations of the best blood and culture. It was
gratifying to perceive that the enviable possessor
of one of the largest private fortunes in New England
was evidently richly endowed by nature with
every charm which could lend grace to the brilliant
position in society that she without doubt is destined
to fill.</p>

<p class='c005'>The “Herald” representative inquired further as
to the past history of Miss Brewster, and learned
that she was the only child of a physician, was born
in Cambridge, has spent some years in foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>travel and study under the chaperonage of a distinguished
leader of society, was presented at the Court
of St. James, and received marked attention from
some of the scions of the oldest and noblest houses
of England.</p>

<p class='c005'>She is supposed to have had a small independent
fortune of her own, but having literary and philanthropic
tastes, has quietly devoted herself to study
and works of charity, thus depriving society of one
peculiarly fitted to be one of its brightest ornaments.</p>

<p class='c005'>The connection between the defunct millionaire
and the charming girl upon whom he has lavished
all his wealth seems hard to prove. From all that
could be learned, however, it seems conclusive that
an engagement existed between them, and that the
death of Mr. Dunreath was a great shock to the
fortunate lady of his choice. In the absence of any
family or near relatives, Mr. D. being an only son
and a bachelor, she will find no one to dispute
the will. This latter point was confirmed by her
lawyer, Mr. Kilrain, of No. 55 Pemberton Square,
who, however, remained very provokingly non-committal
on all other points of interest, intimating
that he was thus obeying the instructions of his fair
client, who modestly wishes to avoid the sudden
notoriety which her fortune will necessarily bring
upon her.</p>

<p class='c005'>A call on some of her co-workers in the Associated
Charities revealed the fact that Miss Brewster
is ardently absorbed in her work, and has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>peculiarly successful in winning the hearts of the
street <i><span lang="fr">gamins</span></i> in her district. She is interested in
various charities, and it is anticipated that her increased
wealth will not lessen the time nor the
interest which she has devoted to her various benefactions.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was intimated from one source that Miss
Brewster holds very pronounced views upon women’s
rights, and will probably use a great part of
her wealth in advancing the cause of female suffrage,
but this we are loth to believe.</p>

<p class='c005'>(Extract from the “Boston Globe.”)</p>

<p class='c005'>... After waiting an hour and calling at three
different times, the representative of the “Globe”
was finally so fortunate as to encounter the fair lady
in whom the public is now feeling so warm an interest.
She had just returned home, and was standing
in the hall with her little toque of wine-colored
velvet still crowning her chestnut tresses, and her
tall, stately figure draped from head to foot in a
fur-trimmed cloak of the same shade.</p>

<p class='c005'>She received the “Globe” representative most
courteously, ushering him into a cosy little reception
room, and meanwhile drawing off the <i><span lang="fr">gants
de suede</span></i> which encased her shapely hands. She
seemed nervous and tired, but had a brilliant color
which deepened perceptibly when requested to grant
an interview. The involuntary look of surprise
and <i><span lang="fr">hauteur</span></i> which accompanied this only enhanced
her beauty, but quickly recovering herself she replied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>without embarrassment that there was nothing
whatever that she wished to state to the public.
She had not been apprised of the nature of the will
until within three days. Since then she had been
overwhelmed with business arrangements, and was
very tired and wished to see only her intimate
friends.</p>

<p class='c005'>One question, however, she so far forgot herself
as to answer, namely, as to whether she should
change her residence. She replied that she purposed
soon to leave town for an indefinite period.
A further question designed to draw out some information
regarding her acquaintance with Mr.
Dunreath, whom it is certain she has for a long
time corresponded with, met with no reply beyond
“I will bid you good evening.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Brewster is certainly a very prepossessing
lady. In addition to her beauty her voice is particularly
well modulated and pleasing. She is decidedly
above the medium height, and has a queenly
air combined with a brisk, business-like manner,
which gives evidence that she is at once a lady and
a shrewd woman of the world,—an indication of
anything but the helpless state into which most inexperienced
women would have been thrown at so
sudden and astounding a change of fortune.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the gaslight and with such a color Miss Brewster
had the appearance of being not over twenty-three;
we learn, however, on unquestioned authority
from a former schoolmate of hers, that she is
just twenty-six, having had a birthday last week.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Miss Brewster is said to be a very devout church-woman
of the ritualistic type, and usually attends
the Church of the Advent.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Hub is certainly to be commiserated at the
prospect of so soon losing a lady who would otherwise
become one of its most admired belles as well
as a leader of its most cultured society, and we
trust that her stay though indefinite may not be
prolonged.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three of the one hundred and twenty-seven letters
received by Miss Brewster during the first
week after the above newspaper extracts appeared
will serve as types of the whole.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Permit me at this moment of your joy and unprecedented
good fortune to present to you my
most heartfelt congratulations.</p>

<p class='c005'>Perhaps you may not recollect my humble self,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>as you always impressed me with such a sense of
awe and dignity that I dared not venture to disclose
to you the <em>profound</em> admiration which I have
always felt for your <em>exalted</em> character.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rarely have I known such a nature as yours.
One so endowed with all the charms and graces of
a <em>goddess</em> and a <em>saint</em> it has never been my fortune
to meet. Do not think I am flattering you, <i><span lang="fr">mon
ange</span></i>; but ever since the first moment when my
eyes fell on your face suffused with dewy tears, as
you bade good-by to your native land, you have
been the ideal of my fondest dreams.</p>

<p class='c005'>I sailed with you on the steamer, like you bound
for those shores of mystery and delight which from
childhood’s hour had haunted my imagination, now
<i><span lang="fr">hélas!</span></i> never to be revisited, for I—how can I say
it?—have been doomed by fate to lose <em>all</em> that is
most dear to me.</p>

<p class='c005'>I had kept my diamond earrings until the last,
but yesterday even those, my last precious treasures,
had to be sacrificed. How can I relate to you
the story of our disgrace!</p>

<p class='c005'>A year ago papa failed, and we were obliged to
leave our palatial home on Fifth Avenue and betake
ourselves to a small hotel on W. Ninth Street.
I nearly cried my eyes out. I spent days and
nights in weeping over our sad fortunes, and as one
by one I was obliged to surrender the darling treasures
of happier days I felt that if this were to go
on I should either become a <em>hopeless wreck</em> with
shattered nerves and end my days in a lunatic asylum,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>or else that rather than suffer the mental torture
which I had endured I should with my own
hand take the life which was a <em>curse</em> to me.</p>

<p class='c005'>Everything has gone from bad to worse, though
I have fought against fate with all the passion of
<em>desperation</em>. Our friends have deserted us; that
is, all the young society which I care about and
really need to keep up my spirits and make me
cheerful. I can find no congenial society in the
class with whom I am doomed to associate, and so
I keep my room, and solace my sad hours with
works of fiction, which for the time being take me
out of myself, and with fancy work, which is the
one little link that connects me with my happy past.</p>

<p class='c005'>But now a crisis has come in papa’s affairs. He
is offered a position in Jersey City, and compels us
to go with him to this <em>odious</em> place, to live in a
second or third rate boarding-house, away from
everything that makes life endurable.</p>

<p class='c005'>I <em>cannot</em> do it. I should simply be burying myself
alive. To one of my sensitive temperament
the shock would be too great, and I know that I
should become but a wreck of my former self.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have racked my brains and tossed on my sleepless
pillow many a night, endeavoring to solve the
problem that is before me.</p>

<p class='c005'>This morning a ray of light dawned upon the
gloom which has enshrouded me. I picked up the
morning paper and read the delightful announcement
of the good fortune which has come to you.
My heart throbbed with sympathetic joy, <i><span lang="fr">mon amie</span></i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>to think that in this desolate world at least one
whom I loved was <em>completely</em> happy.</p>

<p class='c005'>The report says that you are soon to go abroad.
Like an inspiration the thought came to me, “Oh,
if only I could go with her as a <em>companion</em>!” The
thought fairly suffocated me. Once the idea of
attempting to go as a paid companion, of accepting
money for services rendered, no matter how valuable
they might be, would have brought the blush
to my cheek. But my pride has been humbled,
and though even now I could not do it for every
one, for <em>you</em> whom I <em>adore</em> it would seem no sacrifice
but a privilege.</p>

<p class='c005'>I could be of invaluable service to you in shopping
and in visiting galleries. I speak French perfectly,
and could play whist or sing to you when
you are tired. I know how to arrange flowers, to
design toilettes, to order dinners, and can read
aloud without fatigue. I could relieve you of all
care, and this you will certainly require, as so many
new cares have devolved upon you, and you must
be distracted with all the new things you have to
order and to attend to.</p>

<p class='c005'>What steamer shall you take? I like the North
German Lloyd best,—don’t you?</p>

<p class='c005'>I can be ready at a moment’s notice. I await
your answer in an <em>agony</em> of suspense.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Miss Brewster</span>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Dear Miss</span>,—No doubt you will be very much
surprised to get a letter from me for you don’t know
me at all and I don’t know you at all and I persume
you are not used to getting letters from strangers.
But you are a rich kind lady and as a last resorse
I turn to you for my heart is bleeding and my
friends can’t do no more for me. I am an inventor
as you will be surprised to learn. Ever since
I was able to hold a jack knife and whittle I have
been whittling out things and making inventions.
Some folks say I am a genius and if I had my
rights I should be rolling in welth and be able to
keep a horse and carriage.</p>

<p class='c005'>My inventions have been about all sorts of
things. I almost got a patent for a clothes-wringer
but a mean sneak of a fellow stole it from me
taking the bread from my children’s mouths. My
wife took in sewing and washing and the children
milked the cow and kept the garden running and
sometimes I got odd jobs. But a month ago Susie
and Jimmie took sick with scarlet fever and wife
she was up with them night and day and she took
sick too and first Jimmie died and then Susie, and
mother the next day.</p>

<p class='c005'>I did the best I could and the neighbors was
kind and came in spite of its being so catching.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>But now there all gone and nobody but the baby
and me is left. He had it light and wan’t down
but a day or two. I feel most crazy when I think
of it all and wonder what I’m going to do. The
neighbors cooked up some vittles for a few days
but there poor too and I can’t count on them for
doing much.</p>

<p class='c005'>I’ve got to do something right off and I an’t
a cent of money more than enough to pay the postage
of this letter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Last night when Mis deacon Allen went by
with the newspaper she had got to the P. O. she
stopped and read me all about your getting rich so
sudden and she said to me brother Silas if I was
you I’d just write to that Miss Brewster and if
she’s a woman with a heart in her she’ll feel for
that poor motherless little feller there a toddlin
about, and you with your hands tied sos you cant
leave him a minute. I’d take him myself said she
if my hands wasnt tied too. Which is true enough
for shes five of her own and one adopted.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Miss Brewster if you could take my baby
for a while, his name is Orlando and he is 18
months old and help me make a man of him and
get on my feet a little and carry out a scheme I’ve
got for an improved churn I’d thank you to my
dying day. I aint a great hand at farm work for
I cut my foot in a mowing machine and have been
lame ever since and my hearing is bad. So you
see there aint much I can do except invent and
sometimes if it want for the inventing I think Id
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>rather die. But I do feel sure sometime if I can
only get a chance I can invent something that will
sell and then I can repay you.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you send for Orlie to go to Boston I must stay
there too. I couldn’t bear to be so far away from
him. I should die of lonesomeness. Couldn’t
you get me a chance there? I am forty-six years
old and a professor.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

    <div>EXTRACT FROM MISS BREWSTER’S DIARY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>For the first time since the lawyer’s call a week
ago I sit down to collect my wits after this whirl
of excitement, and, like the old woman in the
nursery rhyme, ask myself if it can be that I am
really I.</p>

<p class='c005'>I am frightfully tired, and it may be childish to
write this all out for no one’s eye but my own. I
cannot sleep, however, and I feel as if it would be
a relief and might cool the fever in my veins to
calmly make a record of some of the momentous
events of these last few days. So many things are
crowding upon me that I fear my mind will be a
chaos if I do not attempt something like this to
help me to quiet and arrange my thoughts.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Mr. Kilrain came with the cablegram and
letters, I neither laughed nor cried nor fainted. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>was perfectly calm. I did not realize it in the least,
just as a girl never realizes what it all means when
she kneels before the altar as a bride, or when she
stands beside the dead white face that she has loved.</p>

<p class='c005'>After the real meaning of the thing dawned upon
me and I began to comprehend that I, whose golden
dreams had been quietly put aside forever, was
now actually to realize those dreams, to exchange
prose for poetry, and insignificance and uselessness
for tremendous power such as I had always longed
for,—when the possibilities of it all came over me
and I saw that I could now actually build all my
air castles on this earth, besides doing many other
things of which I have dreamed,—it gave me at
first a thorough ague fit, followed by a burning
fever which nothing could allay until I had seen
my will written, signed, and witnessed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every one thought it such an odd thing for me
to think of at first. Auntie said, “Wait and take
time to think it over, dear. You are laboring under
a nervous strain now; wait and rest and enjoy
yourself a little while. Go to Hollander’s and order
a fine outfit. I will help you find a French
maid, for you will need one, of course; then travel
after that, if you like. Take time to make up your
mind. It isn’t possible for you to know how to
spend such an enormous sum wisely without great
thought.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I could find no rest, however, until I had put beyond
a peradventure the danger of my dying and
leaving nothing done towards carrying out all the
projects which have been so dear to me.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>My will is made, and though I may change it
next week,—doubtless I shall change it more than
once as I get more wisdom,—I know that it is in
the main as I shall let it stand.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Kilrain’s partner and uncle Madison start
at once for South America to look after my interests,
and transfer my stocks and landed property as
soon as possible into our government and railroad
bonds. I cannot bear to feel that I am employing
hundreds of people whom I do not know, and who
may suffer from the extortion of villainous agents
and overseers whom I cannot control. If I could
go to South America myself, and if I understood
enough of business to administer my affairs personally,
I might, perhaps, do as much good by giving
employment to great numbers of people there, and
treating them in a helpful Christian fashion, as by
anything that I can do at home.</p>

<p class='c005'>But it would take me ten years at least to learn
the language and know the people and the business
merely in its outlines. My lawyers say it would
require half a dozen of the shrewdest men simply
to make investments and oversee the overseers, and
I can foresee that a woman dependent on lawyers
and agents is in no wise to be envied. So I am
determined to free myself from these worries as to
the details of making money, and devote my whole
energies to making this fortune, which has so
strangely fallen to me, tell for good in the future
of our country.</p>

<p class='c005'>I am sure that nowhere else in Christendom can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>money be made to produce such far-reaching results.
Last night I lay awake for hours, planning
this work. My mind is made up. For the next
few years I shall travel and study, first, the resources
and necessities of our own country, and after
that the social and economic questions in the
Old World. Meanwhile I shall begin to carry out
some of my schemes at once, and not wait for lawyers
and trustees to squabble over my money after
my death.</p>

<p class='c005'>As I am planning to leave Boston soon, I determined
to meet some of the people whom I have
chosen as trustees of certain funds. Accordingly
I invited five people of different religious faiths,
the broadest-minded and most public-spirited persons
known to me,—Revs. P—— B——, A——
McK——, E. E. H——, P—— M——, and Mrs.
A—— F—— P——. Not one of them had an
inkling as to what it was all about, or knew who
were invited beside himself. Mr. Kilrain was
there in obedience to my request. I wished him to
see that everything was done legally, and, besides,
to draw up all the necessary papers.</p>

<p class='c005'>I fairly shivered with delight and excitement as
they came in one by one and I introduced myself
to them, feeling very much like a young queen who
has just ascended a throne and summons her generals
and wise counselors to plan a campaign.</p>

<p class='c005'>I had a dainty lunch served in a cosy little parlor,
and as soon as the servants were gone I began,
rather tremulously, it must be confessed, to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>my little speech. They all knew, of course, that
they were invited to give me counsel on some philanthropic
matter, but further than that they were
in the dark. As nearly as I can remember this is
what I said:—</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are all aware that I have asked the favor
of your company to-day in order to discuss a serious
matter involving the expenditure of a large sum of
money. I wish to avail myself of the united wisdom
of those present to enable me to use for good
and not for evil the enormous wealth which has so
suddenly dropped from the skies, as it were, into
my hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I count myself as simply a steward, and know
well that before my own conscience, if before no
other tribunal, I shall be called to account for my
stewardship.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is stated that one of the seven greatest sources
of pauperism in London is foolish almsgiving. I
am perfectly aware that I may ‘give all my goods
to feed the poor,’ and do more harm by it than if
I threw my offerings into the Charles River.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am convinced that if I would help any man
I must do it by giving him the means to help himself,
and thus to retain or gain his self-respect.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My thoughts and affections go out most
strongly to our own country, and therefore most of
my money is to be spent in it. I feel that by helping
to outline the new paths which multitudes are
to follow here, I shall best help the progress of
humanity everywhere. But I am not so narrowminded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>as to think it right to wait until we get all
the industrial schools and kindergartens that we
need here, before we teach the first elements of
decency to our brothers and sisters in Africa and
every other stronghold of heathenism and savagery.
My childhood was spent with earnest people who
were interested in the missionary work. As a child,
I read the ‘Missionary Herald,’ and gave my mite
towards building the Morning Star.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But of late years I have lived in a society
whose sentiment has been more than half contemptuous
of foreign missions. ‘Let us civilize the
heathen at home,’ they say; ‘let us do the duty that
lies nearest, and not meddle with what is none of
our business.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am tired of this prating and ignorant talk by
would-be cultured people who know nothing of the
real results of missionary work. They find no fault
with actresses or sea-captains or Bohemians who
choose exile for gain or pleasure, but they are always
ready to cry out against the folly of one who
goes to teach men the alphabet, and tell women that
they are something more than beasts of burden or
mere child-bearing animals.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am constantly meeting people who talk as if
Buddhism contained all that is of value in Christianity,
and who actually scoff at any attempt to
disturb what they call the picturesque, simple faith
of their carvers of ivory bric-à-brac.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I revere Buddha. I do not ignore the fact
that in all ages God has not left himself without a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>witness, and that many seers and prophets have
led the nations toward the light. But I prefer the
sunlight to the twilight, and what vision of truth
has come to me I would pass along to others. Especially
do I long to help the women. Sometimes
their degradation and helplessness appeals so powerfully
to my imagination that I feel that I must
give my money and my time without stint, until
selfish, indifferent Christendom is forced to remember
what is the true condition of two thirds of the
world.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I was trembling all over with nervous excitement,
and, as usual, was so absorbed in what I was saying
as to quite forget to wonder what these five people,
so much older and wiser and more experienced
than I, must think of my sitting there and talking
to them in this fashion. I am dreadfully afraid
it must have seemed conceited or audacious or
something of the sort. However, they knew nothing
about me or my ideas, and as it was quite
necessary that they should understand my position
before they could give me any counsel, I proceeded
to make it known.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not content,” I said, “with most methods
that have been used. Sectarianism, bigotry, and
ignorance have often perverted the best results.
The good souls who fear to send a preacher, no
matter how devoted, unless he preach exactly their
‘ism,’ seem to me to be retarding by many years
the consummation so devoutly to be wished. The
most Christlike men whom I know could not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>sent out as missionaries by the American Board.
I believe there are hundreds of ardent young souls
who would be led to offer themselves for work in
foreign lands if the restrictions of creed did not
stand in the way.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do not misunderstand me. I do not condemn
creeds. Doubtless every one who thinks must
have some kind of a creed, however short it be.
But in the making of bequests, in endowments
which are to help affect the thought of future generations,
it seems to me difficult to avoid ultimate
lawsuits, temptation to mental dishonesty, and infinite
harm, unless the founder works on the broadest
principles and sees the work begun in his lifetime.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have written my will this week and have devoted
a very large sum of money for the establishment
of a fund, the amount of which I shall not at
present name, to be used as follows:—</p>

<p class='c005'>“For the management and expenditure of this
fund I have chosen five trustees. These shall
fill vacancies in their number as they occur from
death, resignation, incapacity, or whatever cause.
One member, at least, shall always be a woman,
and as many as three Christian denominations shall
always be represented among the five trustees.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The fund shall be called the ‘Christian Missionary
Fund,’ and the work shall be, so far as the
trustees are concerned, entirely unsectarian, though
always distinctly Christian and Protestant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The fund shall be devoted to the following
purposes:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“First, for promoting the spiritual and mental,
and thus indirectly the material, welfare of the
most helpless and degraded people on the globe.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Second, for promoting Christianity and education
in lands like Japan, where there is already an
awakened aspiration for better things, and hence
the most immediate results may be anticipated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Third, for promoting such measures as shall
diminish the slave-trade wherever it exists, and for
preventing the liquor traffic between civilized and
barbarous nations, for instance, such as is now disgracing
and desolating the Congo State.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Any man or woman who applies to be sent out
as preacher, teacher, or agent, for promoting any of
these ends, shall be accepted if he or she give satisfactory
evidence to the committee of being fitted
to do sufficiently helpful work in the positions to
which they are assigned. No acceptation of any
creed shall be required of any applicant. After
being enrolled for the work, however, all shall be
required to leave detailed written statements of
their religious beliefs. These are to be kept on file
for statistical purposes, together with the records
of the subsequent work of the candidates, their
methods of labor, and the results accomplished.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Every woman employed by the trustees shall
receive the same salary as a man would receive for
doing the same work. In sending out preachers
and pastors no distinction shall be made in regard
to sex. All women desiring to preach and to administer
the sacraments shall be authorized to do
so if possessed of proper qualifications.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>In regard to that latter clause I had had considerable
discussion with auntie previous to convening
the trustees.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Isn’t that a little odd?” she asked. “I am
afraid some clergymen would be shocked at that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aunt Madison,” I said, “if it is desirable to
have the sacraments of communion or baptism celebrated
at all, I can see no reason why they cannot
be done by a woman’s hand as well as by that
of a man? If the hand that made the bread does
not desecrate it, why may not that same hand
break and pass it, provided it be done in a proper
spirit? Is a man’s hand any more sacred than a
woman’s?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, it isn’t that,” said auntie, fidgeting a little;
“but it is the words and the service which
go with it, of course.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly,” said I,—rather bluntly, too, I am
afraid,—“and those words consist of quotations
from the words of Christ and Paul, and a prayer.
I see no reason why quotations and prayer uttered
by a female voice may not be just as acceptable to
the Almighty as if spoken by a male voice. (I
hate those words ‘male’ and ‘female,’ but I
thought it would help her to see the absurdity of
our conventional notions about such things.)”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, dear, perhaps so, if you look at it that
way,” she said; “but what do you think the apostles
would have thought of such a thing?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As a matter-of-fact,” said I, “the members
of the early church, who ate at one table, and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>all things in common, and celebrated their Lord’s
death at the close of their meal in the simplest
way in the world, probably passed the cup from
one to the other informally, and women as well as
men took part in what little service there was. It
seems to me in this age of common sense on other
subjects it is time we had a little more of it in
religion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>How saucy that appears as I write it. I wonder
if I am getting dictatorial.</p>

<p class='c005'>I told the trustees, that, although their work as
trustees was to be entirely undenominational, and
that they were to discourage any sectarian work in
whatever schools and churches might be established,
this was not to be interpreted to mean a refusal to
send good men and women, even if they held narrow
sectarian views. I hold myself too liberal to
refuse to send any one who can do any good, even
though he hold mediæval views on eschatology.
If a man can persuade a savage to wash his face
and stop beating his wife, I am willing to allow him
his cassock and crucifix and all the joys of a celibate
High Churchism, so long, at least, as he holds
himself responsible to no other body than the committee
of my choosing. I have observed that a
fair amount of civilization, intelligence, and real
Christianity can co-exist with a very crude theology.
So any good man who cares enough about helping
his fellow-men to work hard on a moderate salary,
as an exile in a heathen land, shall not be hindered
from going until enough better men offer
themselves to take his place.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>I told my guests that I wished to begin the
work at once. Without stating whether or not
they were the trustees referred to in my will, I
asked them to assume for the next three years the
responsibility of disbursing two hundred thousand
dollars annually in the way I had specified. I
shall keep the money in my own hands so that they
need not be troubled about investments, and shall
pay the amount in installments, as they call for it.</p>

<p class='c005'>I requested them to do exactly as they thought
best, without any more reference to me than if I
were dead, except when they came to any misunderstanding
in regard to the interpretation of my
wishes as expressed above.</p>

<p class='c005'>I shall have accurate reports of their proceedings,
and thus be able to rectify any point that is left
obscure, or that is capable of abuse.</p>

<p class='c005'>I requested that my name should not be made
known in connection with all this.</p>

<p class='c005'>When I had finished there was a pause; then
Dr. H—— in his genial way began—But I can
write no more to-night.</p>

<p class='c005'>(Extract from an editorial in the “Church Inquisitor.”)</p>

<p class='c005'>It is with feelings of mingled interest and alarm
that we report as the most notable of recent events
in the religious world the announcement of an
enormous bequest for foreign missionary work.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why alarm?” may be asked. But a careful
reading of the provisions of the bequest which we
publish in another column will assure the reader
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>that the conditions under which it is given are unprecedented
and allow possibilities so dangerous as
to create great anxiety in the minds of those who
are well grounded in the faith and zealous for the
maintenance of pure doctrine. As it is needless
to say that in matters of such moment we hold
that the most stringent regulations and careful
scrutiny should be exercised, it is evident that the
utter abolishing of all tests, allowing the teaching
of the most dangerous heresies by Unitarians,
Universalists, Spiritualists, Christian Scientists and
what not,—and this to be done in the name of
Christian Missions,—is startling, to say the least.</p>

<p class='c005'>It will be readily seen that to the mind of the
untutored savage unable to distinguish genuine
Christianity from that which is spurious, and as
likely to accept the one as the other, the danger of
confounding the two to the discredit of all true
piety will be great, if the restrictions laid down in
the bequest are to be binding.</p>

<p class='c005'>To be sure, the men and women sent out by
this fund must be presumed to possess a fair
amount of intellect and moral character, though
how their spiritual condition is to be ascertained
before hearing a statement of their creed we fail
to see. Doubtless something may be done in the
way of building up schools and supplementing the
work of those whom our Board sends to preach
the gospel. For this we rejoice and give thanks.
Knowing the genuine Christian character of some
members of the committee, we are led to hope that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>they will deem no one fit to send out as a proclaimer
of the doctrines of Christianity who holds
the evidently loose views of the framer of this
singular bequest. As only one of the trustees is a
Unitarian, and as Unitarians are proverbially indifferent
to foreign missions, it seems to leave considerable
ground for the hope that none of that
sect will apply, or, if applying, will be sent.</p>

<p class='c005'>The donor’s name is withheld, but it is shrewdly
surmised to be the late Mr. Albert Danforth of
Springfield, formerly a noted Free-thinker, but who
is said to have had a deathbed repentance and to
have attempted to appease his conscience by bestowing
his vast wealth in the manner described.
In this case why his name should be withheld remains
a mystery.</p>

<p class='c005'>It will be noticed that another peculiar feature
of the bequest is that one trustee at least shall always
be a woman. In the course of time there is
nothing to prevent all of them being women, as
four of the five appointed are known to be in favor
of female suffrage. As the late Mr. Danforth,
among his other radical notions, held the same unscriptural
view of woman’s functions, the promotion
of “women’s rights” views by the endowment
in question is to be feared.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is, perhaps, well enough to pay women in the
mission field the same sum as that given to men
for the same work, though this possibly would be
too attractive an allurement for some unworthy
persons who might assume the sacred duties in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>question for the sake of the loaves and fishes.
But what seems especially unwise as well as wholly
unscriptural, and of which we feel compelled to
assert our disapproval, is the provision that women
shall be permitted to administer the holy sacraments.
See Corinthians i. 14, 34, and xi. 3, 7.</p>

<p class='c005'>There seems to be no serious objection to women
preaching to assemblies of their own sex where
male missionaries cannot be admitted; but that
such an extreme step should be taken as to desecrate
and turn into a farce the ordinances of baptism
and the Lord’s Supper by allowing them to
be administered by a woman, is something that we
must deplore.</p>

<p class='c005'>Were it not that most of the trustees appointed
represent the new school of thought, which seems
to rely more on reason than on the Written Word,
we should wonder at their being able to satisfy
their consciences if they accept responsibilities encumbered
by such restrictions.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear Alice</span>,—I ran away from Boston
without saying good-by to you. Dr. Wesselhoeft
predicted all sorts of horrors—hysterics, St. Vitus’s
dance, nervous prostration, and I don’t know
what else, if I did not at once get away from the
hosts of people who drove me distracted with an
incessant ringing of the door-bell from breakfast
until bedtime. I was not aware that I had so
many friends before. Every pupil I have ever
had, every passing acquaintance even, has felt it
to be his or her privilege and duty to call and congratulate
me and bore me to death with their ecstasies
and flatteries.</p>

<p class='c005'>I rather liked it at first, I must confess. It was
all so novel to me, and it showed some of my acquaintances
in an entirely new light, which, I
found, gave me an admirable opportunity for a
study of character on its drollest side. Whenever
I entered the reception room and found it lined
with callers waiting all on tiptoe for my appearance,
I really felt like a president beset by office-seekers
during his first month at the White House.</p>

<p class='c005'>But a few days of all this rather nauseated me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>and I thanked my fortune that it had not come
at my birth, but had allowed me to make many
true and tried friends before bestowing on me what
I fear will now always make me suspicious of a
lack of disinterestedness in every new-comer.</p>

<p class='c005'>However, in leaving Boston and coming to New
York I fancy that I have only jumped out of the
frying-pan into the fire, for letters pursue me everywhere.
I devote every forenoon to reading them
and dictating replies to my amanuensis. Many
of them are applications for money or help of some
sort, some of them outrageous, and some very pitiful
indeed. I had one some days ago from a poor
fellow in Vermont, who fancied himself an inventor.
He had just lost his wife and two children, and
implored me to “help him make a man” of the
only little one left to him. His letter sounded so
forlorn that it went to my heart, so I sent telegrams
of inquiry about him to the postmaster and
the minister in his native town. They answered
my questions satisfactorily, and I sent at once for
the man to come.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such a dazed, bewildered-looking creature as he
was, to be sure, when he stepped out of the carriage,
which I had sent for him, and stumbled
clumsily up the steps with his baby, tied up in an
old red shawl, in his arms!</p>

<p class='c005'>He told me the simple story of his life, its little
ambitions and narrow outlook; of his conversion
and his courtship, and of the horrors of disease
and death and poverty, to which his pinched face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>and trembling hands bore witness. The boy was
a pathetic little morsel of humanity, and his sad
little mouth won my heart. I have taken charge
of the child, and, please God, I will “make a man
of him.” The father is quite unfit for hard work,
and what to do with him I did not know, when
suddenly I bethought myself of a magazine article
which you loaned me some time ago, apropos of
“A Universal Tinker.” The man is clever with
tools, I hear, and just the one to do odd bits of
mending and attending to the thousand and one
things which are always getting out of order
about a house. So I sent him with a letter to all
my Back Bay friends, and eight of them have offered
to pay him five dollars a month each, on condition
that he keep everything in their establishments
in repair. I have given him a chest of
tools, and have found a good home for him. A
widow in straitened circumstances, whom also I
wish to help, but who will not accept charity, is
glad to receive him and his child into her family.
Really, the man seems already like another creature.
He has taken on a new look of self-respect
and courage that makes his commonplace, weather-beaten
face fairly radiant.</p>

<p class='c005'>This whole experience has given me intense
satisfaction. I had almost made up my mind to
pay no heed to these calls, which demand so much
of my time and prove, at least half of them, to
come from frauds and impostors. In fact, it was
merely as an experiment, and chiefly to indulge my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>curiosity, that I heeded this case. I am now determined
to have every appeal for help that seems
at all deserving thoroughly investigated, and I
foresee that I shall be obliged to have more than
one agent to attend to it all.</p>

<p class='c005'>I had an extraordinary experience last night, of
which I must tell you, though my ears tingle yet
at the thought of it. I wonder if this is a foretaste
of the penalties which I am doomed to pay for the
sin of being a great heiress. I had always wondered
how rich women could endure to make such
a display of diamonds at parties and balls as to necessitate
their being dogged by private detectives
everywhere. I always maintained that a woman
was an idiot who would thus let herself become
such a slave to her wealth. I was sure that any
one who lived simply, and did not care for show,
could go alone where she pleased, and have no
fears; but my theories are getting sadly shaken.
However, I am digressing. Now about this affair
last night.</p>

<p class='c005'>I received a beautifully written note the other
day, delicately perfumed, and bearing a seal
stamped with a coat of arms, and signed Manuel
Altiova. The writer intimated that he had been a
friend of Mr. Dunreath, and had matters of importance
to tell me. He begged the favor of an interview.
I surmised that he was a scamp, but, on the
other hand, thought it possible that he might be
some titled wealthy Spaniard who had met Mr.
Dunreath in South America, and who could give me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>some information about the locality of my possessions.
So I had my amanuensis send him a formal
note in reply asking him to call on me last evening.</p>

<p class='c005'>I told my maid Hélène to remain in the next
room with the door ajar, and when his card was
sent up, followed almost immediately by himself, I
arose to receive him with some curiosity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tableau. Enter, with many bows, a tall, black-eyed
man of perhaps thirty-five, clad in faultless
dress; in short, to all outward appearance, an elegant
Adonis.</p>

<p class='c005'>I let him tell his story, and said nothing for
awhile. He professed to have been most intimately
acquainted with Mr. Dunreath, and produced a
photograph of him. Subsequently, he showed me
some letters in Mr. Dunreath’s handwriting referring
to some dishonorable business transactions by
which Mr. D. had greatly augmented his fortunes,
and for which he would have suffered the full penalty
of the law except for the timely and most self-sacrificing
intervention of his “noble and devoted
friend,” Manuel Altiova.</p>

<p class='c005'>I was thunderstruck. The hot blood mounted
to my temples, and for a moment everything seemed
to reel before me. Was all my happiness a dream?
Was I then enjoying the ill-gotten gains of a
swindler? I looked at the letters. There could
be no mistake about the handwriting. That very
forenoon, with my lawyer, I had been carefully
examining a dozen documents in that same queer
crabbed hand, which I had known so well in the
days when I was a girl and had a lover.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Five years ago it was, but it seemed fifty, as I
sat there staring dizzily at those letters and trying
to realize that this man whom I had loved almost
enough to marry, this man whom I would have
sworn was honor itself, was false, basely false.
Oh, it seemed a thing incredible; yet, as I thought
of how in these last few years for month after
month society has been shocked by the fall of
those who have stood most high in our esteem, yet
who have been tempted to sell their souls for gold,
I believed it all.</p>

<p class='c005'>I remember thinking vaguely of how I must try
to find out the men whom Mr. Dunreath had defrauded,
and return to them this money, which was
theirs, not mine. Then I roused myself and questioned
him, trying to appear as indifferent and non-committal
as possible, though I could feel my temples
throbbing, and I knew my cheeks were hot.
He answered my questions without the slightest
hesitation, giving names, dates, and localities with
startling readiness and apparent sincerity. He
mentioned various little peculiarities of Mr. Dunreath’s,—his
never eating butter, his being left-handed,
and so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last I could ask no more. I felt as though I
should suffocate. The man went on talking, however,
telling his own family history. His father
was a learned professor, his mother a lady of noble
birth. He was born at Barcelona, had been destined
from childhood to take orders in the Romish
Church, and was finally disinherited by his stern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>father for his avowed Protestant and Republican
doctrines, to say nothing of his refusal to wed the
woman of his father’s choice when all hope of his
entering the church had been abandoned. With his
own little private fortune of twenty thousand dollars
he had sailed for Brazil, and had entered the
service of Mr. Dunreath. Soon he became the devoted
friend of that gentleman, was intrusted with
his confidence, and became cognizant of all his affairs.
Mr. Dunreath had fully expected to return
to him the thousands which he had so generously
made over to the officials in the nick of time, thus
preventing the pursuit which would have ended in
his arrest and conviction, with the subsequent surrender
to the state of many of his millions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Altiova, or rather Señor as he called himself,
presently let me understand the chief purpose
of his visit. As you will readily guess, he desired
me to pay him the sum which he had spent, namely,
twenty thousand dollars, all his little fortune. In
another letter which he produced, Mr. Dunreath
had promised to return this sum doubled, and this
promise was in the act of fulfillment on the very
day of the fatal sunstroke.</p>

<p class='c005'>Señor Altiova modestly disclaimed any desire
that this generous offer should be fulfilled by Mr.
Dunreath’s heirs, and declared that he would be
quite content to receive only the sum which he had
spent. He paused for my reply. Meanwhile I
had been gradually collecting my wits, and was able
to control my voice enough to say that I must first
consult with my lawyer.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“But, Miss Brewster,” he urged, “that, you
see, is impossible. Will you disclose Mr. Dunreath’s
felony? Will you create a needless scandal
and lose your fortune? No; if you will but
settle this little business with me (the sum, of
course, is but a mere bagatelle to a rich lady like
you), the secret will remain forever buried in my
bosom, and no mortal shall know what has passed
between us. The moment you hand me your
check for twenty thousand dollars, payable to the
bearer, that moment you shall with your own hand
burn these incriminating letters.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I reiterated that in spite of the danger of bringing
ignominy upon the name of my old friend, I
should consult my lawyer before taking any steps
in the matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I can’t wait,” he retorted almost fiercely,
and there was a look in his eyes which made me
start. My heart rose. Could it be that those terrible
letters were only clever forgeries? He instantly
recollected himself, however, and his tone
assumed a touch of pathos.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Brewster,” he said, and there was a
tremor in his voice as he looked at me beseechingly;
“my mother, whom I have not seen for years, is
dying. The physician gives her at most only a
month to live. Unknown to my father she has
cabled me to return instantly. Ah, my sweet
mother,” he murmured, as if speaking to himself,
while his eyes were wet with unshed tears, “the
moments are years until I see her. Oh, if I should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>be too late! And then—who knows? perhaps,—yes,—perhaps,
if I may stand beside my mother’s
deathbed, my stern old father may be reconciled
to me—may bid me stay, and I may have the
unspeakable comfort of sustaining his declining
years.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I watched him keenly. If this were acting, it had
been very good acting until now. But these last
few words had a false ring in them, which even my
unpracticed ear detected. With a mournful sigh
he showed me two miniatures painted on ivory, one
the face of a handsome, dark-eyed woman, the
other that of a scholarly-looking man of middle
age. These, he said, were the portraits of his father
and mother, and as he returned the latter to its
velvet case he pressed it tenderly to his lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was very touching, and I was half convinced,
especially when my eye fell again on that curious
handwriting whose peculiarities I knew so well.
The man evidently saw that I was agitated and
afraid that his story might, after all, be true. He
continued:—</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Miss Brewster, I have no money. I arrived
here last week from Rio Janeiro. My father
has disinherited me, as I have told you. My little
private fortune, my mother’s gift, which I could
have doubled in a year’s time by my investments,
was all given to save my friend. Madame!” he
cried, “where is your sense of justice—simple justice—if
you refuse me the paltry sum which saved
the reputation and wealth of the man whose heiress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>you now are? You have his own confession here
before you, signed with his name. The evidence is
unimpeachable. If I bring it into court, it may
cost you half your millions. Madame, the Urania
sails to-morrow, I must go. I must have money,
the money you owe me. If you refuse”—</p>

<p class='c005'>I rose to bring this extraordinary interview to an
immediate close. I was shaking from head to foot
and thankful beyond measure that Hélène, who
had doubtless heard the whole conversation, understood
too little English to realize its import. I was
convinced that I had to deal with a very shrewd,
clever villain, who had worked up his facts most
adroitly, and was trying a desperate confidence
game. But he was not to be gotten rid of so easily.
Suddenly falling upon one knee, he grasped
my hand as I stood before him and poured out a
torrent of words, of which I remember nothing, for
I was too indignant and astounded even to think of
calling upon Hélène. We must have looked for all
the world like the tragic pictures in the “Police
Gazette,” which my naughty youngsters used to display
behind my back at the Mission School.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly I came to my senses. I don’t suppose
the whole scene lasted half a minute at most.
Tearing my hand away, I was rushing for Hélène,—who,
as I learned afterward, was sound asleep,
with the door blown to,—when, as a last bit of
desperation, what did this man do, but snatch a
dainty little pistol from his hip pocket, and before
I could scream or even gasp an articulate word he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>aimed it at his temples and seemed about to fire.
I can hardly tell what I did then. I believe I
screamed, and I must have rushed upon the madman,
for the next instant I found myself with the
pistol in my hand trying to fire it up the chimney,
while the Señor lay prostrate apparently in a swoon.
But the pistol would not fire; evidently it was not
loaded. I dropped it into the smouldering ashes,
and staggered into the next room, where my stupid
maid lay soundly sleeping on the sofa. Faint and
trembling I dropped into the nearest chair. I could
not have walked six inches further, and was too
weak to attempt to arouse Hélène. On the whole,
I was glad not to do so, for she would have been too
frightened to be of the least use. Moreover, she
would have raised the neighborhood with her
shrieks, while I should have been ready to die with
mortification and disgust.</p>

<p class='c005'>In imagination I saw the lurid head lines of the
next day’s columns of society gossip and scandal.
“Dunreath’s Defalcation!” “How it Horrifies
His Heiress!!” I saw myself posing as the heroine
of a sixth-rate dime novel; on whose pages
alone, as I had always supposed, such experiences
as this ever took place. It did not take three seconds
for all this to flash through my brain and
make the cold sweat stand out in drops upon my
forehead.</p>

<p class='c005'>Just then I heard a faint click, and summoning
courage to look into the drawing-room, what was
my unutterable relief to find the room empty. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>wretch had vanished. To tell the truth, at that
juncture I came about as near verifying the doctor’s
prediction in regard to hysterics as I ever did
in my life.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now for the sequel. This afternoon I received
the following note, which I inclose for your benefit.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Madam</span>,—John I. Carrigain, alias Court Peperino,
alias Dr. Kametski, alias Manuel Altiova,
aged thirty-four years and seven months, was
born in Manchester, England, of an English father
and Portuguese mother, received a good education,
was arrested for forgery at the age of nineteen,
served out a sentence of five years, and on release
was sent to New York by a charitable agency. He
was suspected of being accessory to one of the
largest swindling operations ever undertaken in
New York city, but as nothing could be proved, he
was released from custody and began operations in
Chicago, obtaining money under various false pretences.
At first he met with great success, but was
finally convicted and sentenced to six years in the
state prison. He was released from Joliet six
months ago, but, until your communication last
night, had not been known to be in New York. A
person answering his description was seen to take
the northern express last evening with a ticket for
some point in Canada. The man is a clever forger,
and it would require an expert to detect his work.
It has been ascertained that Carrigain was assistant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>clerk for Mr. Dunreath for a few months seven
years ago, which accounts for some of his information
regarding the habits of that gentleman; and
as for the handwriting and the South American
details, he is quite clever enough to have worked
those carefully up in the last few weeks.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is needless to say that his career will henceforth
be closely watched.</p>

<p class='c005'>By the way, Alice, I am having my portrait
painted, full-length, in a blue velvet tea gown. I
give a sitting every other afternoon, and on alternate
days visit tenement houses, industrial schools,
and Castle Garden. I saw two thousand filthy
Italians of the lowest kind land yesterday.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have just come home from a tour through the
Mulberry Bend where these creatures herd together.
I felt as if I were in Naples again. I thought some
parts of Boston were bad enough, but I never
saw anything on this side of the water equal to the
horrible squalor and loathsomeness of these places.</p>

<p class='c005'>I mean to take all your good advice about being
calm, and trying not to feel that it devolves upon
me to settle all our social problems this month. I
know even better than you the complexity of the
difficulties in our congested city life. I have little
hope of doing much for this generation of pauperism
and vice, but I am determined to do whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>my money and good will can do for laying the
foundation of better things in the generation to
come.</p>

<p class='c005'>I am going to begin with tenement houses, for
there, I believe, lies the root of half of the trouble.
I suppose my friends will think that I am getting
to be a dreadful doctrinaire. Well, it can’t be
helped. I was predestined for that, I believe. My
consolation is that you at least will not be bored by
all my plans and theories, and will warn me if I
get too rabid....</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The night after I had first seen Mildred Brewster
at aunt Madison’s I lay awake for hours, feverishly
tossing upon my pillow, and revolving many
thoughts. I then made one resolve. I would try
to win the friendship of this woman who had
touched me, who had moved me in a way that no
one had ever done before.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was not so much by what she had said, for I
had heard the same or kindred thoughts expressed
by other lips; but I had never before met a woman
so strong, well poised and thoughtful, a woman who
united girlish grace and charm with all the persistent
ardor of one who, I was sure, could not only die
for an idea, but, what is far rarer, live for it day by
day and year by year, although forced to meet indifference
and coldness or the quiet contempt which
cuts to the quick in every sensitive nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>As I had sat by the firelight that night, watching
the color come and go in her face,—that changeful,
eager face,—for the first time in a dreary twelve-month
I had felt my heart leap up with warmth and
sympathy. From a thoughtless, happy girlhood,
from the life of a gay, pleasure-loving young lady,
I had been rudely summoned to face some of the
bitterest realities of life. No matter what they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>were. I am not writing about myself. But though
my life was still rich and full of opportunities, if I
had but known it, yet in my blindness and selfishness
it had seemed utterly wrecked to me. I had
sunk into a dull, prosaic routine, and under a proud
mask of gay indifference was trying to hide a heart
dead to hope, ambition, and love. Yet, no! not
dead to love, though I had thought it so; but in
the heart-hunger which was not satisfied, I was fast
becoming self-centred, cold, and cynical.</p>

<p class='c005'>Like a dreary desert the long years which must be
lived stretched desolately before me, and my only
aim was to fill the minutes of each day so full as to
leave me no leisure for memory or thought.</p>

<p class='c005'>As I closed my eyes to sleep that night my last
thought was, “Yes, I <em>will</em> know her. I <em>must</em> know
her. Oh, if I could only be like her, a creature of
thought and purpose, absorbed in some idea, caring
for something beside my wretched, silly self! Perhaps
she can help me. I will ask her. I can trust
<em>her</em>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I had been deceived in others; I had given my
utmost trust to those who had proved utterly unworthy,
and in bitterness of spirit I had resolved
never to trust again, never to leave the gateway
to my heart unguarded; but now, before I knew it,
the locks had yielded, and I stood with lonely, outstretched
arms, begging for love to enter in. After
all, I was still young, and very, very human.</p>

<p class='c005'>And love came. It came before my fallen pride
had found words to ask for it. I had something to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>live for now. <em>I had found a friend.</em> What romance
has ever been written that tells of woman’s
love for woman? And yet the world is full of it,
despite the skeptics, and the Davids and Jonathans
find their counterparts in thousands of the unwritten
lives of women. Yes, I had found not a new
acquaintance, but a warm heart-friend. Thank
God that she knew it and I knew it before the
wealth which came so fast upon the beginning of
our friendship could create a gulf between us,
which, once established, my pride would never have
allowed me to cross. Mildred knew, she always
knew, that I had loved her first, and wanted her
for herself alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>I knew, when the wealth came, that it would not
make her any the less my friend, but I was only
one among her many friends. I knew that our
paths would be different now, and though she
would always think kindly of me, I could not expect
to see and know her as I had fondly dreamed
in the first days of our friendship.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I can never return to her what she can give,
what she has already given to me; my little life can
play but a small part in the large life that has come
to her,” I said drearily, as I turned back, after the
first shock of surprise, to readjust myself to the old
routine of thought and feeling, which, I had dared
to hope, had been put behind me forever.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, well, I have made believe be happy before,
I can do so again,” I said to myself, grimly.</p>

<p class='c005'>But one day—how well I remember it—as I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>passed down Chestnut Street in Salem noting the
brilliant winter sunlight shining down from the
cloudless blue through the black lace work of
branches high arching overhead, and casting fantastic
shadows on the brick walls of the stately old
mansions on either side, some one handed me a
letter. This is what it said:—</p>

<p class='c005'>... “You asked me to be your friend, you said
I could help you, and now I ask you to be my friend,
to come here to this great city where I must be for
a time and help me. I felt brave and strong at first,
I was not afraid to be rich, but I begin to tremble
now, to feel strangely weak and girlish and unprotected;
to feel, in short, that I need a friend, that
I need what I think you can be to me. After aunt
Madison had been with me only a few days she was
obliged to return to Boston, leaving me quite alone.
Of course Madam Grundy says that I must have
a chaperon, but I do not want a chaperon, and I
should be wretched with a ‘companion,’ perfunctorily
trying to entertain me, learning all my plans
and secrets, and hypocritically assenting to everything
I do and say. No; I want an honest friend,
one who knows the world as you do, who will honestly
speak her mind, who will take an interest in
all my schemes, and help to keep me from making
blunders.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe I could talk more freely, think more
clearly, and do better work if you were beside me,
your honest eyes looking into mine. For, let me
tell you the secret, dear, of what first drew me to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>you. You are most strangely like the sister whom
I lost years ago, and whose companionship, if she
had lived, would have made life so rich for me. I
feel myself so alone; never before have I had so
keen a sense of loneliness as now, here, in this modern
Babylon, with my old life and work abandoned,
and the new perplexing life which my wealth has
brought me just begun. Like me, you are alone
in the world, singularly alone; so come and be to
me what my little Ruby would have been. When
you speak I could almost believe that I hear her
voice; when you look at me I see her eyes again.
Your face haunts me. Come to me and I shall feel
that my Ruby is with me again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Standing in the sunshine beneath the old elms
I read these loving words. When I lifted my
eyes again, the beautiful quaint old street was
suddenly transfigured. For months it had been to
me but a bare prison-house; now the sunshine was
real sunshine, the sky was no longer leaden, the
world was, after all, a beautiful world, and I was
glad to live.</p>

<p class='c005'>So bidding farewell to quiet Chestnut Street and
the staid, historic old city, I went to the “modern
Babylon” to meet Mildred, and the new life began.
As the days went on I perceived that she seemed to
have a feverish dread that she should die with her
work undone. My constant anxiety was that she
would succumb to the fearful nervous strain which
her sudden accession to wealth and responsibility
had brought upon her. But nothing seemed to rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>her or relieve her mind except the accomplishment
of some of the ends she had in view, and as every
new project was consummated, she showed a relief
and delight that to the average society woman
would have appeared inexplicable and at the same
time amusing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It seems to me,” said Mildred one day as we
were strolling through the park, after a morning on
Cherry Street; “it seems to me that most people
have no imagination. It cannot be that all the
pleasant, cultured people whom one meets are so
shamefully heartless and indifferent. They simply
have not the smallest realization of what is going
on in this great city, or any thought of their personal,
individual responsibility about it. They
hear it all as a tale that is told. They have always
heard it. They are used to hearing it. From constant
hearing it has become as meaningless to them
as the Lord’s Prayer has to most people. How
many who dare to say ‘Thy kingdom come, on
earth as it is in heaven,’ ever actually mean a word
that they say, or lift a finger to bring it about?”</p>

<p class='c005'>We walked on in silence. Presently Mildred
burst out again:</p>

<p class='c005'>“We are so apt to think that because we eat our
three meals a day, and can buy our opera tickets
when we feel like it, that all the world is doing
well, and that if people are miserable it must somehow
be their own fault.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am convinced that if any people ever needed
missionary work, it is the society belles and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>well-bred, cultured men of the clubs, who know so
little and care still less for this vast multitude of the
ignorant and suffering and fallen here at their very
doors, and who look with calm indifference on these
hideous sores upon our modern life.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I promise you, Ruby, after I get some of my
irons out of the fire, I mean to devote myself to a
crusade to rescue what George Eliot calls the
‘perishing upper classes.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“But ah,” she sighed, “it needs genius for that,
and I have only money. Oh, I would give half my
millions if I had the scathing pen of a Carlyle, or
the power to plead for humanity like Mrs. Stowe
or Walter Besant or Dickens; if I could stir the
hearts of the people with flaming words that should
help to sweep away the sloth, indifference, and contemptible
arrogance that makes one tenth of us
forget that the other nine tenths are our brothers
and sisters!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If every one were as self-sacrificing as you,
Mildred”—I began; but she interrupted me almost
sternly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hush! never say that to me. What have I
ever sacrificed? Nothing, absolutely nothing. I
have always had comforts; now I have everything
that heart can wish. In giving to others I deny
myself nothing. Never dare to let me for a moment
imagine that I am doing anything more than the
simplest, most obvious duty. I must not cheat my
conscience. I should be the veriest hypocrite if I
allowed myself to think that I am generous. Is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>there anything generous in paying one’s debts, particularly
when one has not had to earn the money
with which to pay them?</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have always observed,” she continued, “that
a little decency in a millionaire goes a long way.
I am not above temptation, and I have already discovered
that I am in danger of coming to believe
that my simple good will, common sense, and capacity
for sympathy are something rare and remarkable.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Every one thinks to please me by telling me
so. Do not let me deceive myself. I have a clear
vision now; help me to keep it and to be faithful.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mildred’s voice quivered, and she drew my arm
in hers while we walked back to our rooms in silence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But the world is growing better, Mildred.
Every intelligent person admits that people are
more kind and thoughtful than they used to be.
No one who has read history could deny it,” I resumed,
as once more within doors we sat down before
the glowing grate to finish our talk.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You and I believe it, dear, because we believe
in God, and because we believe that this is God’s
world and not the devil’s,” Mildred replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Half the women whom we saw parading their
fine toilets this afternoon believe it too, not because
they know enough about history to see in it the
unfolding of the divine idea, but because they like to
believe it; because it makes them very comfortable
to believe that by taking money which some one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>else has earned and paying an annual fee out of it
to orphan asylums and hospitals, or to any outcome
of our modern altruism, they are thereby relieved
from all further responsibility.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But here is an intelligent man,—an English
university man, who has read history as well as
you and I, and he says it is false. This is what
he writes,” said Mildred, taking a thick letter from
her writing-desk. She held it unopened for a
moment and continued: “I met him when I was
in England. We had many a talk in our rambles
together at Kew and Hampstead Heath. He is a
friend of William Morris and like him a socialist
of the deepest dye. I don’t half accept the accuracy
of all his statements, but he is an honest man
and a gentleman. I am glad to know him, for I
cannot afford to be ignorant of such a man’s views
on our social problems, however much I may dissent
from them. Now let me read you his letter.</p>

<p class='c005'>... “You ask me to give you suggestions for
the expenditure of your wealth in benefiting humanity.
This I must decline to do, my dear friend.
If I had your wealth I know what <em>I</em> should do, or,
at least, what I ought to do, but <em>I</em> am a socialist,
and <em>you</em> are not. I do not believe in <i><span lang="fr">laissez-faire</span></i>
as you do, and as a socialist I should use my
wealth and influence for a reorganization of society,
not for a patching up of what is at bottom false
and rotten. Things are getting worse and worse,
and must continue to do so under the present social
system. My hope is that they will get so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>bad, so unutterably vile, that the people will be
compelled to throw aside their apathy and make a
clean sweep. I take no part in any of the hundred
little schemes for ‘improving’ the present system.
I don’t want to improve the present system as you
do. I want to destroy it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We improve things that are already fairly good
and can be made better, but we destroy whatever
is thoroughly rotten; at least I think all rational
people do so. So far as the present order is at
all bearable, it is due to certain socialist innovations,
such as interference with the capitalist, trade
unions, movements like that of the Irish against
the particular class of thieves called landlords, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The people, the common people, who for centuries
have silently suffered and abjectly kissed the
foot that kicked them and trod upon them, the
people, I say, are beginning to wake up. They are
beginning to ask questions, and they are questions
which will have to be solved erelong, even if it take
another bloody French revolution to do it. I see
no way in which bloodshed is to be avoided. I
look forward confidently to what will seem to you
very like a reign of terror ere this century closes.
Things must grow worse before they can get better.
The crisis has not come, but it is coming. Money
has done much, but it cannot do everything; the
press will not always be bribed and muzzled as it is
to-day, nor Levi’s and Mulhall’s and Giffen’s statistics
be doctored to suit the capitalists who pay for
them. The time is coming, Miss Brewster, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>the people <em>will be heard</em>; and <em>they will be heeded</em>,
for their words will be as short and sharp as fire
and dynamite can make them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do not think I am telling you of what I wish to
see. I am telling you of what I know will come.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The rich are not voluntarily going to heed the
bitter cry of the famishing, except in one way, the
only way they have ever known, namely, almsgiving.
They will give alms because it is noble to be a
benefactor, because it appeases their consciences,
because it might be made extremely inconvenient
for them if they did not. But they will not give
justice. Justice! they never learned the meaning
of the word.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But some day these landed aristocrats ‘whose
thin bloods crawl down from some robber in a border
brawl,’ who have never lifted their finger to
earn a penny in their lives, and who owe all that
they have to these same robber ancestors,—these
people, I say, will some day be taught the meaning
of that same word ‘justice’ by some of the forty-five
millions of landless people in our little island.
I shall not soon forget how quickly the subscriptions
for the poor went up a year or two ago, after
the riots.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have no conception, Miss Brewster, you
can have no conception, of the state of things here
at present. Six millions of our people are living
on the brink of pauperism. I tell you, when I sit
down to my omelette and toast in the morning and
reflect that there are two hundred thousand human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>beings within two miles of me who don’t know
where they are going to get their next meal, when
I read of the hundreds of children who habitually
go to school without any breakfast, and who not unfrequently
faint dead away over their books, I tell
you it doesn’t make my own breakfast relish any
better.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One night in the autumn, a year or two ago, I
passed through Trafalgar Square at twelve o’clock,
and counted four hundred and eighty-three homeless
people lying out in the chill air upon the bare
stones. Not one of them had fourpence wherewith
to pay for a night’s lodging. And this, remember,
was only one spot.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There were many others where a similar sight
might have been seen.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Ah,’ but you say; ‘these are the dissolute
and drunken, those who love to be vagabonds.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I assure you that you are much mistaken. I
have seen and talked with thousands of these people,
and a large number of them, probably a fourth, are
men from the country who can find no work there,
and have found none here—honest, hard-working
British laborers. Two thirds of these people are not
vicious, or drunken, but they are out of work, they
are cold, they are hungry, they are naked, they are
outcasts in this Christian (?) land which has enough
for all its children. All they ask is work, hard
work, dirty work, work for twelve hours a day, but
that they cannot get. Why? Because our accursed
modern society is irrational, wasteful, utterly selfish.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Plenty of money, plenty of things worth doing,
plenty of men who would thank God if this work
could be given them to do; but what does our
mad, maladjusted society say to them? ‘Emigrate!
Clear the country! Away with you! We have
no use for you.’ Malthus was right, after all, and
we must reverse Browning.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you know of the blacksmith women in the
‘black country’? I have recently been there,
giving some addresses. Oh, the hideousness of it
all, with its starving people, its wretched, stunted
lives, its ghastly ugliness, its brutalized men and
women! One sees women, who should be at home
nursing their babies, standing on their feet from
morning till night doing the work of men, swinging
the hammer amidst grime and soot and incessant
noise. And if one of them drops at her post from
sheer exhaustion, there is a fiendish clanging thing
that bangs on the floor and shakes every bone in
the poor wretch’s body.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. —— took Henry George to see the sight
when he was here, and he told me that George
swore until he was black in the face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I know you think I am a hot-head; you will
say these are exceptional cases. You will doubtless
try to do what all the good rich people do (I admit,
you see, that there are <em>some</em> good ones); you
will doubtless try to help palliate all these horrors.
If you were here you might build an old men’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>home for the poor men to whom society has never
given a chance, who, through no fault of their own,
have been forced from their cradle to live in stifling
attics or damp, unwholesome hovels, breathing
poison, working their fingers off to give their hungry
children bread. You might build a comfortable
home where these decrepit, useless old fellows
might enjoy the food which you give in charity,
wear your charity uniform, and look forward to filling
a pauper’s grave, as does one in nine of all the
people who die in London. Or you might build a
splendid marble palace of a hospital or asylum, and
herd together vast numbers of little boys or fallen
women or cripples, and try in some big, mechanical,
institutional way to do with your pound of cure
what an ounce of prevention would have accomplished
a thousand times better, if it could have
come in the way of justice, not charity. Charity!
how I loathe the word! It is the iron which sears
the conscience of your rich Christian as does nothing
else. He thinks to buy heaven with that word.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I tell you, Miss Brewster, these people want
what you and I want. They want to preserve
their self-respect, to have a chance once a week to
remember that they are human beings and not
machines. They want to be able in this Christian
land to earn an honest living, to keep their
daughters from the streets, and to keep soul and
body together without sacrificing all decency and
honor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How much delicacy and fine moral sentiment, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>say nothing of physical comfort, do you suppose is
to be had in the sixty thousand families of London,
each of which lives in one room?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you rich people suppose you are going to
help this matter greatly by leaving money in your
wills to build asylums for the moral and physical
wrecks for which our incredible folly and selfish
indifference is responsible?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your time will come; sooner or later you will
find much the same condition of things in your
own great cities. Do not believe that in some
mysterious way—as your politicians and newspapers
are trying to teach you—you, in America,
are different from us.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We are all in the same boat, because the structure
of society is everywhere the same. Money
is literally king and god. It rules us everywhere,
and it is bringing about a state of things with
which the order imposed by a German Kaiser is a
mild and beneficent régime. Indeed, I am not sure
but that the greatest social crash will come in the
United States, unless you soon come to recognize
that a new order of things must be brought about.
You pride yourselves upon your universal suffrage,
but of what value is a vote to a poor man who
must risk his bread and butter if he dares to vote
contrary to his employer’s wishes? What avails
universal suffrage when one third of your legislators
can be bought, and votes go to the highest
bidder? No; universal suffrage is totally inadequate
to save us under the existing order of things.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“I am a socialist simply because I am a rational
human being, who knows the facts; because I am—I
venture to think—endowed with reason and
imagination.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not imagine, however, that socialism is
going to produce any perfect ideal order. I simply
see that the economic order which has sustained
the civilized world for the past two or three hundred
years is now falling in pieces and must be
replaced by something; that we are approaching a
period that will spell either socialism or chaos.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If unhappily chaos should come, it will be due
to the opponents of socialism, which is the only
peaceful, rational method of social organization
under the new economic conditions, due to machine
industry and the contraction of the world by
means of the great scientific discoveries of our
time.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you want to see a fuller statement of my
views and the grounds for them, look at the article
on Socialism in the ‘Forum’ last month. But we
socialists spend years in study, and we can’t give
the results adequately in a brief form. Miss Brewster,
I feel that you are in earnest, far more in
earnest than most women whom I have met from
your country. I do not wonder that you are perplexed.
I would not change places with you. I
would far rather have the sure conviction of the
truth as I see it, and be of little power in advancing
the cause I believe in, than to stand as you do,
rich, powerful, overwhelmed with responsibilities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>not knowing how to use your power, and trying in
vain to patch up and prolong the existence of what
is destined to be swept away ere the next generation
shall have come and gone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Smile at my pessimism if you like; time will
verify my words. If ever you come to see this as
I do, perhaps then I may suggest some things for
you to do with your millions.”...</p>

<p class='c005'>(Miss Brewster’s reply to the foregoing letter.)</p>

<p class='c005'>... “Your letter has deeply stirred me. Not
that anything you say surprises me, or is new to
me; but behind the words, I know, are the sad,
dreadful facts for which they stand; and, being a
creature endowed with some imagination, I can in
some measure realize what that simple statement
means, when you say that six millions of your people
are on the brink of pauperism.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good God! what endless heartaches, what physical
misery, what degradation of mind and soul is
implied in those few words! I am glad you do not
envy me my wealth. I am beginning to think that
I am not so much to be envied as I thought at
first I might be. I have been amazed, in these
last few weeks, to learn from numberless sources
of the chagrin, disappointment, and perplexity of
many rich men and women who have thought to
benefit the world by the ‘charity’ which you so
despise. They have put up great institutions, only
to find that in many cases it was the least helpful
thing that they could do; that a large part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>money was spent on taxes, insurance, agents, servants,
go-betweens; that, after all, when they had
gathered their orphans or cripples or old women
together, they had brought about an utterly cheerless,
artificial state of things, and have proved that
for the average human being with natural human
instincts the poorest home is often more preferable
than the most palatial asylum.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So, set your heart at rest. I am not going to
spend my money in that way. Whatever may be
the political and social changes which will take
place in the next twenty years,—and doubtless
they will be many and great,—of one thing I am
sure, no new condition of things can be made permanent
or harmonious except by means of two
things. The first of these is moral character.
The second is intellectual insight into cause and
effect and relation. In any condition of things we
must have righteousness, and we must have trained
minds. You will doubtless agree with me that
selfishness and ignorance are the two monster
dragons that are threatening now, as they always
have done, to devour us, only we should differ as
to the way in which they are to be slain. You
have a definite theory as to how this is to be done,
which I do not yet thoroughly understand. I see
your goal, but I do not understand how you propose
to reach it without doing away with individuality
and crushing out some of the deepest human
instincts. True, many of our instincts are brutish.
There is still the tiger and the ape within us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>which, as John Fiske says, is our inheritance of
‘original sin’ from our brute ancestors. I agree
with you that such instincts must be eliminated,
but how? By dynamite, fear, revolution, legislation?</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are right: we may make the selfish fear,
and that is often a very salutary thing to do if
nothing better can be done. A business man was
telling me only the other day of the different relations
between employers and employees in Fall
River and other manufacturing places since the
strikes of the last few years.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, after all, though fear and legislation can
do something to convert a brutal man into a decent
man for a time, there must needs be something
else,—the gospel of love and humanity, which of
his own free will he must choose to accept and
apply understandingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall not attempt to palliate any of the existing
evils, nor, on the other hand, shall I attempt
to undermine our present social and political system
even if I could. Certainly I shall not try to
do this until I am very certain that I see the right
method of substituting something better in its
place.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By the way, have you read Bellamy’s ‘Looking
Backward’? It is very suggestive, and Nationalization
of Industries is getting to be more of a
fad in Boston than Esoteric Buddhism or Christian
Science. Bellamy tells us what we must try
to attain; but, alas! he gives little hint of what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>must be our first step toward the attainment.
This is the problem which you and I must help our
generation to solve.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go on with your socialistic schemes. I believe
they contain a half truth; at all events, to talk
about them as you do will make people think, for
you speak from the deepest conviction. Out of all
this <i><span lang="de">sturm und drang</span></i> period must surely come
clear insight and right action: at least I am optimist
enough to hope so; and my work shall be to
think out the solution, as far as I may, but at all
events to do what in me lies to set people to thinking;
to make life a little sweeter and better; to
infuse into it more hope for a few of my generation,
and thus help to make their children ready
for the new order of things if it comes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In this great city money flows like water. There
are streets where, for a mile, every house must be
the home of a millionaire, for no one else could
afford to live in such a one. Yet, within two
miles of these palaces there is the direst want, the
most frightful squalor, and the problem of New
York is fast getting to be like the problem of London.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Most of our women dabble a little in charity
now and then. They get up charity balls and
fairs to satisfy their consciences in that way, and
flatter themselves when they spend their money
lavishly in luxuries for their own pleasure that
they are giving employment to the poor and doing
God service. They will sometimes give their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>money; they will sometimes give a little time to
cut out garments at a sewing circle; but not one
in five hundred will give her personal service even
for a half day a week in coming face to face with
those who need the help of her intelligence and her
human sympathy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of this I am convinced: men are never to be
uplifted permanently, except by human sympathy,
intelligently directed and expressed, and by personal
contact with those who do not come to them
to dole out ‘charity,’ but who come as brothers
to lend them a helping hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are a few who begin the work; there are
fewer still who continue it. The other day a gentleman,
who is giving his life to the rescuing of
street children, told me of the faintheartedness of
his voluntary helpers, who come a half dozen Sundays
to his mission, but who rarely come longer
when they discover that, to use his own coarse but
forcible words, which you will pardon my quoting
verbatim, ‘<em>they must be willing to pick lice off
those children for Christ’s sake</em>.’...</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, dear friend, we are both working in very
different ways. You would tear down; I would
build up, or ‘patch up,’ as you say. Which of
us is the wiser, time will tell; but however differently
we may labor, it is for the same end after all
that we are striving,—‘putting society on a just
and rational basis,’ as you would phrase it, or
bringing God’s kingdom upon earth, as the Christ
called it,—and so I bid you God-speed.”...</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One morning in April we had risen from a leisurely,
late breakfast, a luxury which, with our press
of work, we did not often allow ourselves, except
when, as in this case, we had been up late the previous
night.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hélène brought in the usual bulky bag of mail
matter, and we settled ourselves to our morning’s
task, I taking charge of all letters that were not of
a private nature, and consigning to the waste basket
innumerable quires of paper devoted to more
or less roundabout appeals for aid, and lectures
and advice <i><span lang="la">ad libitum</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Occasionally we stopped to read aloud to each
other bits of the letters, and discuss or laugh over
their contents. This morning I remember I was
examining a document in regard to a prison reform
society, containing a request that Mildred would
allow her name to be used as vice-president of it,
when an exclamation from her startled me into
dropping the letter and turning round.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, what now?” I asked, in response to the
intimation from the puckered forehead and pursed-up
lips that something was the matter. “Another
love-sick poet? or is it a count this time? It must
be time for another suitor; you haven’t had an
offer of marriage for at least ten days, have you?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“Indeed, Ruby, this is no joke, I assure you,”
replied Mildred, gazing blankly at the letter in her
hand. “It is from General Lawrence.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What!” I exclaimed; “that distinguished-looking
man who has written all those books upon
political economy? He talked with me in such
an entertaining way the other night and told the
funniest stories. I was afraid he would be awfully
erudite and dry, but he wasn’t at all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No; he can be very entertaining,” sighed Mildred.
“I have met him several times since we
have been in New York. He was a classmate of
papa’s at Yale and a gallant soldier in the war.
Judge Matthews said he thought him one of the
clearest and ablest thinkers in the country, and it
seems that years ago he had achieved a European
reputation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” I said, “I have seen his articles in the
‘Fortnightly’ and ‘Edinburgh’ reviews, and he
spoke the other night as if he were well acquainted
with Browning and Froude and half of the literary
people of England.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“His wife wore fine sapphires, and I overheard
her say that she was devoted to German opera,”
added Mildred, musingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, what of it?” I asked, much mystified at
this apparently irrelevant remark.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, only this,” answered Mildred, dryly;
“this entertaining society man, this famous political
economist, writes to me this morning piteously
begging for an immediate loan of ten thousand dollars
to keep the sheriff out of his house.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“Heavens! Mildred. Why, I supposed he had
enough money to live on,” I cried, aghast. “He
lives in one of those pretty two-thousand-a-year
apartments up by the park, does he not? I have
heard people say what a charming little home they
had, and everything in such good taste. Pray how
have they managed it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, in the simplest way in the world—on
other people’s money,” replied Mildred, with a
shade of scorn in her tone. “The fact is, as all his
friends know, he is as poor as a church-mouse. But
he has always been accustomed to living well, and
he has not the faintest idea of household economy
in spite of his fine theories of political economy.
He is generous and warm-hearted, and helped papa
with a loan when he was in college trying to live
on three hundred a year, and I cannot forget a
kindness like that. Of course, it would be the easiest
thing in the world for me to give him the ten
thousand outright. A loan would be a gift for
that matter, for he could never repay it, as his income
is only three thousand a year, I fancy, and his
expenses are at least one or two thousand more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course his wife must be the cause of all
this,” I remarked. “Any woman who will spend
borrowed money on sapphires”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, they were probably heirlooms; she came of
a rich family,” interrupted Mildred.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No matter,” I continued; “any woman who
will wear sapphires and has the assurance to go to
a dinner party with its attendant expenses of dress,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>carriage, et cetera, when she cannot pay her debts
and expects at any minute to be sold out of house
and home, is a woman who deserves to have a
pretty sharp lesson taught her, and I hope you will
do it. Now, don’t let those blue eyes of his and
that majestic manner overawe you and cajole you
into feeling that you owe him a debt of gratitude
to be paid by getting him out of this emergency;
for it will serve only to let him teach his children
that the highroad to comfort and ease is to go
on the principle that the public owes a genius a
living.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I do not mean to do that,” replied Mildred,
thoughtfully; “but I cannot let this disgrace come
to them when I can help it as well as not, and it is
a rather awkward thing for me to dictate conditions
to a man who is old enough to be my father, one
who has risked his life on many a battlefield, and is
a genius and a famous scholar. I cannot lay the
blame on his wife. She adores him, and he thinks
her failures are better than other people’s successes.
The whole family in fact forms the most genuine
mutual admiration society. They seem utterly oblivious
of the fact that in letting their milkman’s
bill go unpaid, and in giving their children money
to go riding in the goat carriage in the park, they
are doing anything dishonorable.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Every one who knows them says they have no
more wisdom in bringing up their children than
two babies. They let them eat and drink what
they like, sit up as late as they like, and care more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>about their speaking French and German well than
about their knowing the multiplication table, or
anything practical.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If they were not such devout churchpeople, one
would not be so amazed at this extravagance,” ejaculated
Mildred warmly, “though perhaps genius
may be pardoned for lacking common sense and
common honesty,” she added, grimly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then rising, she continued, as she put on her hat
and gloves: “I know what I shall do. I have a
scheme for helping him in a way that will be something
more than merely giving him immediate material
aid. I know a dear old lady who used to be
papa’s friend and his, and I will go at once to see
her. She can tell me some facts that I need to
know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Two hours later, she had but just returned when
the General called.</p>

<p class='c005'>He looked nervous and flushed, and I never saw
Mildred seem more embarrassed. In an adjoining
room I awaited with some impatience the close of
the interview.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last she came into my room, and throwing
herself down on the white bear-skin rug before the
grate, she exclaimed, with a little groan, “There,
I’ve done it, though it was the most painful thing
I ever did in my life. I felt that I must seem so
mean and arrogant to make myself the arbiter of
the fate of a man like him, and to dictate terms
which must have been horribly humiliating. Think
of my setting myself up to instruct a man who has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>deserved the honor of the friendship of men like
Mazzini and Von Moltke and Carlyle and Sumner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How did you begin?” I queried, realizing for
the first time what a difficult thing this must have
been to a generous-hearted girl like Mildred.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh,” she said, “I began by reminding him of
his kindness to papa, and assuring him that I was
ready and glad to be of assistance to him. He
looked so grateful that I found it almost impossible
to screw up my courage to continue. But, after
stammering over it a minute, I put on a bold front
and went on to say that I felt it my duty to make
my gift, for it was to be a gift, not a loan, upon
certain stringent conditions in order that similar
circumstances might not occur again. I would
state what they were, and then he might consult
with his family and let me know whether he would
accept them or not.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He replied sadly, ‘I am in your hands, Miss
Brewster. There is no question of my volition in
the matter.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“It almost brought the tears to my eyes, Ruby,
for he did look so grand and noble, and it was so
pathetic to think of a man of his powers forced
to humble himself before a girl like me. He said
that for years this shadow of debt had been over
him, making life a purgatory for him, which is true
enough. I hear that he has long been borrowing
from every one of his own and his wife’s relatives,
and has mortgaged everything they own, even her
jewels. One wonders what he can be made of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>to have endured such shame and yet to have
counted it less shame than to live in a small, economical
way within his income. But he spoke of
his debts with all the ingenuousness of a child,
just as though they were an affliction sent by Providence,
for which he was in no wise responsible,
and I really think that he felt them so.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘My first condition,’ I said, ‘is that you shall
give me a full and accurate statement of your financial
affairs, including old debts which are not pressing,
insurance, mortgages, and everything of a
money nature.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“Secondly, I asked that none of his children
should receive private lessons in dancing, French,
or anything else, which were not paid for in full
in advance. I could see that this was a very bitter
thing for the General. One of his daughters is
a girl of artistic talent, and he has been giving her
expensive lessons in painting, for which, as I knew,
he has never paid.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I asked General Lawrence pretty pointedly,”
continued Mildred, “if, so long as a fair education
could be had in our schools without cost, he felt
justified in taking other people’s money to give his
children accomplishments.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And pray what did he say to that?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, nothing,” answered Mildred. “He
looked absolutely dazed, as if it were a totally new
idea. In fact, I do not think that it had occurred
to him that children could be brought up respectably
without knowing French and dancing.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“I wanted to tell him,” said Mildred, “that I
counted the best part of my education to be the
years that I spent studying geography and arithmetic
with both boys and girls, with white and black,
with rich and poor, with Protestants, Catholics, and
Jews, in a public school, where success was gauged
by individual merit alone, and where we little
bigots and partisans learned to be tolerant and respectful
toward one another. One of the most salutary
things I ever learned was that the son of a
ragpicker, in my class, was a better mathematician
than I, and that a mulatto girl across the aisle usually
outranked me.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I told General Lawrence it was my firm conviction
that his children would be far more benefited
by a few years’ study of ordinary English branches
with ordinary children than by anything else he
could do for them educationally, for I feared that
they were growing up to know only one side of life
and only one class of people, and their knowledge
and sympathies would be narrow. He nodded assent,
and I went on.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My third condition was, that he and his wife
should sign a paper promising for the next three
years to allow no debts to any one but me, or some
agent authorized by me, to run beyond a month’s
time. Any failure to meet such debts promptly
must be immediately reported to me for settlement,
for which I should take a mortgage on his furniture
and personal effects.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I told him that my intention was not merely to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>help his immediate and pressing need, but to entirely
free him from debt. Nevertheless, I was unwilling
to undertake this, unless he were ready to
rigidly insist upon living within his income, thus
teaching his children some lessons of self-sacrifice
and thrift. I told him plainly that I was sure a
little different management would reduce his doctor’s
bills, for I had reason to think that his children’s
constant ailing was due to the foolish way in
which they had been indulged. He looked amazed
and annoyed at this, and begged me to specify.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I replied, ‘Mrs. Lawrence herself told me of
three parties which her eight-year-old Gladys attended
within a single week, and she afterwards
remarked incidentally that the child had a tendency
to insomnia and dyspepsia and was taking
medicine all the time. Moreover, your older
daughter privately informed me that she had begun
a diet of vinegar and slate-pencils to reduce
her plumpness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘No,’ I said, ‘I shall not presume to dictate
to you as to the methods which you are to pursue
with your children. But I have seen them several
times and have an interest in them, and I believe
that their character will receive a permanent injury
from the irregular life which they are living and
the false notions they have imbibed in regard to
keeping up a style which they cannot afford. So
for their sake, and in addition to paying all your
debts, I am willing to send the oldest to good boarding-schools
where simple diet, regular hours, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>systematic work can help to make of them a
stronger man and woman than there is prospect of
their becoming now.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I could see that it was terribly galling for him
to have me sit there and arraign him, as it were,
for his conduct; but he clenched his teeth, kept silence,
and heard me to the end. Then he cleared
his throat, and after a moment said, hoarsely, without
looking up:</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Miss Brewster, you are very kind. With your
permission I will call on you to-morrow at eleven.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>The next morning, a half hour after the time appointed,
General Lawrence and his wife appeared,
both looking as if they had passed a restless night.
Mrs. Lawrence, clad in an elegant gown, quite outshone
Mildred, who wore a quiet street costume of
gray serge. That costly dress and the queenly air
of its owner nettled me.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mildred,” I whispered, as she came back for a
pencil, “do think twice before you squander your
thousands on saving those people from the just
penalty of their folly and sin.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not thinking of them so much as of
their children,” said she gravely; “and it is far
more folly than sin. Mrs. Lawrence is a Southern
woman, sweet-tempered and charming, but despising
little economies as petty Yankee meanness,
and she will have to submit to receiving instruction
from me on that score, or else I shall let the sheriff
come.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Mildred certainly did seem somewhat disconcerted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>when she learned that the ten-thousand-dollar
loan which had been asked for was less than half
of General Lawrence’s indebtedness. He confessed,
she told me afterward, that his expenses last year
were over five thousand dollars, while his receipts
from his literary work, his sole income, were only
twenty-eight hundred. “We were obliged, actually
obliged, to go into society more or less on account
of the General’s position,” said his wife, apologetically.
“General Lawrence is continually meeting
important people in the literary and political world,
and can’t you see, my dear Miss Brewster, how essential
this is for his writing? And, of course, if
we are always well entertained ourselves, we have
to treat people decently when they come to see us.
I have been my own seamstress, and have economized
in every way, but it is absolutely impossible
for us to live on three thousand a year. My husband’s
writings would bring us three times that if
he could get what he deserves. But it is always so
with men of genius; their own generation never appreciates
them,” she added bitterly, while her husband
fidgeted and took a turn around the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, and what did you say to such rubbish as
that?” I inquired of Mildred.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I said,” answered she, “that Emerson and
many others had found ‘plain living and high
thinking’ quite compatible, and that I thought a
residence in some suburban town would obviate
the burdens of society, and allow them to live within
their income. At all events,” I said, “although I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>stood ready to offer, as a gift, their entire immunity
from debt, this could not be done except by a strict
construction of the conditions which I had laid
down. However, I offered General Lawrence an
opportunity to lay up a little money, telling him
that I had various projects in view, and should need
the assistance of the pen of a ready writer in carrying
out many of them. I told him that I would
put to his credit in the bank ten dollars for every
newspaper column which he would write on subjects
that I should give him: at the end of three
years this amount should be turned over to him,
and meanwhile he must ‘cut his coat according to
his cloth,’ and manage in some way to live strictly
within his income.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what did Madam say to that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, her pride kept the tears back; they both
said nothing and signed the papers; but I know
that she must think me a hateful, close-fisted Yankee,
with no conception of granting a favor graciously
and without cruelly wounding the recipient’s
feelings.”</p>

<p class='c005'>We saw very little of the Lawrences after this.
It was understood that little Gladys’s health required
country air, and a cottage out of town was
engaged. The children were not sent to school, but
kept up French and read history and literature at
home with their mamma, and although they would
have found it difficult to bound Missouri or do an
example in long division, they could talk glibly of
Louis XI. and the Cid.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Whether a beneficial reform was wrought in the
domestic economy of the family, I never knew, and
I think Mildred had her doubts, though she was
not called upon to pay any more debts.</p>

<p class='c005'>We heard incidentally that the General’s cigar
bills and physician’s fees had not decreased, and
that his last work on the Philosophy of the Greek
Tragedians had received unqualified praise from
Professor Curtius.</p>

<p class='c005'>This little episode was only one of the many
which marked our brief stay in New York, and
gave me an opportunity to study the many-sided
character of my friend. She had some aristocratic
acquaintances in the city who were only too happy
to lionize her, and she was soon overwhelmed with
invitations to lunch parties, theatre parties, et
cetera, in which I was also kindly included.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You must go, dear; I want some one to back
me up,” she used to say at first. “I have courage
enough to go into a pulpit and preach a sermon, or
to go down into the slums alone, or to do a thousand
things which would make most girls horrified,
but I fairly shake in my shoes when I have to be
the target of the eyes of all these society women
and dollar-hunters. I know they would not care a
jot for me were it not for my money, and I cannot
help thinking of it all the time. I feel suspicious
of every one in a way that makes me blush.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can’t talk society small talk; I never could.
I wonder how people manage to do it and wax so
eloquent over nothing,” she once said. “But I suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>I must try to learn how,” she added, with a
comical wry face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why try to learn, why not act your natural
self?” I protested, for I had quietly observed that
Mildred’s simple and unaffected bearing and transparent
sincerity had proved far more attractive
in society than the persiflage and repartee of more
brilliant women, though I knew that she herself
felt conscious of shyness and a sense that she was
out of her proper element.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why not act my natural self?” repeated Mildred.
“Because, my dear, I like to be liked, and
my natural, unconventional self would lead me to
talk of all sorts of things which society would not
like. If I talked as much as I wished to on the
subjects that interest me most, I should be voted a
Boston bore, a woman with a mission, with hobbies,
with theories,—altogether a very unlikable person
aside from my ducats.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nonsense, Mildred!” I cried. “I have seen a
hundred times as much of society as you have, and
I can say that the greatest boon in the way of novelty
would be a little bit of the independence and
freshness so natural to you. You are a woman to
whom real things mean something. You are earnest.
You like to talk about earnest things, and
why should you feel obliged to condescend to the
level of society small talk and meaningless compliments?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I don’t propose to be a hypocrite,” said
Mildred, with a little amused laugh, at my unaccustomed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>vehemence in this line of thought. She sat
for a minute absently picking in pieces the Jacqueminot
rose in her corsage; then she said, “But you
know, Ruby, there is such a thing as being a doctrinaire
and a dull dogmatist, and, on the other
hand, being full of tact and sympathy and wit,
accomplishing the best results in an indirect way,
when no amount of direct preaching could do it.
A woman of character can make even her small
talk a tremendous power if she only knows how to
go to work.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I want to be a power, I honestly confess that,
but I have little worldly wisdom, and I have much
to learn. I have lived in a world of books and
ideas, and now I am thrown into this perplexing,
brilliant, kaleidoscopic world of society, and I feel
as unsophisticated as a girl of sixteen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But there is plenty of homage given you,” I
remarked. “You were the envy of every woman
in the room the other night when Lord H—— took
you out to dinner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Homage to <em>me</em>? Homage to my money, you
ought to say,” replied Mildred, with a touch of bitterness,
as she shook the rose-leaves from her lap
into the waste-basket. “I wore opals and satin,
and am, as the papers say, a ‘great catch;’ but
how much attention do you suppose my lord would
have paid me six months ago if he had met me
running down Joy Street with my bag of books,
to take a Cambridge car?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But plenty of women are admired who are not
rich,” I remarked; “it doesn’t follow”—</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“No,” said Mildred, breaking in impetuously;
“but women are not admired for their real worth.
It always used to madden me to see how the nice,
sensible girls, who really had original ideas and
could say something worth saying, were always left
to be the wall-flowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nine men out of ten actually like a little, helpless
doll of a creature who can talk by the hour
and say nothing; and they don’t care for a brave,
self-helpful girl who has any independence of spirit,
and who does not flatter a man by demanding his
attention and referring to his opinion on every subject
which requires more thought than crocheting
or tennis.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” after a moment’s pause. “Men do not
find thoughtful women interesting. I learned that
long ago. I went to a mixed high school, and
when we young folks went on picnics or sleigh-rides,
it was always the poorest scholar in the class who
had the smallest waist and wore the most bracelets,
a good-natured little society girl, who received the
most attention from the young men. But they
were all callow boys, and I did not think or care
much about them. I knew a few men of the finest
sort who showed me what men could be, and I did
not think then, what I am coming to believe now,
that many of the real gentlemen who mean to be
chivalrous, and who imagine that they give the
highest honor to women, actually admire the Howells-farce-type
of woman above every other,—that
is to say, a pretty, prattling, conscientious, irrational
little goose.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“I don’t know anything about Howells’s women,”
said I, rather surprised at this outburst; “and I
didn’t suppose you ever condescended to anything
less than Hawthorne or George Eliot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh yes, I always read everything of Howells’s,
though I abominate his women. But he is so inimitably
droll and bright, and then the local Boston
flavor of his stories is rather fascinating to a Bostonian,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very likely he does not admire his women himself;
he may simply wish to show up that type,” I
suggested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, and a pretty common type I am finding
it to be after all, though I once used to scorn the
idea,” said Mildred, despondingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then she added, as she nervously twirled the
little silver Maltese cross, the badge of the King’s
Daughters, which she always wore, “I suppose I
have known as little and cared as little about men
as any girl who ever lived. But I have lived too
much like a nun,” she sighed; “this new life of
these past few weeks has awakened me; I feel that
I have missed something.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, dear, what do you wish?” I asked, as
she hesitated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish,” said she decidedly, “that I could
meet some thoroughly fine men with brains and
heart who liked me for myself, who liked what
was best in me. I honestly confess it is pleasant
to be liked and sought after, pleasanter than I used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>to think. I can see now how easy it is to get one’s
head turned.” Then, after a little pause:</p>

<p class='c005'>“But in society we can never be sure what the
attraction is. Everything, vulgarity, ignorance, immorality,—everything
is pardonable with wealth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hush, dear, you are getting desperate,” I said.
“There are, no doubt, many grades of New York
society where all that may be pardoned on the score
of wealth; but you have not seen much of that, so
far, and we have met many really fine, cultivated
people who have traveled and studied and have real
character. You spoke enthusiastically of the talk
about Art which you had the other night over in
the bay window with Professor Stuart and that
English artist with all the letters after his name.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, indeed, they were as entertaining as possible,
and gave me ideas I had never thought of by
myself; but then they were graybeards of fifty. I
was thinking of younger men whom one might”—and
Mildred hesitated and looked out of the window,
blushing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why don’t you finish it,” I said mischievously;
“whom one might marry?”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Mildred only laughed and said nothing.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One morning at breakfast, as we were sipping
our chocolate, Mildred cried out, “Oh, Ruby, I forgot
to tell you! I am going to have a symposium
here to-night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A symposium!—of whom? and what is it all
to be about? Let me hear your latest scheme,”
I queried, laying down my black Hamburgs and
looking up at her. Her face was very bright and
animated, and the scheme, whatever it was, evidently
interested her considerably.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mildred leaned back in her chair and twirled
the beautiful ruby ring which she always wore.
This ring had been her sister’s, and was an heirloom;
she rarely wore any other jewels, and when
she was preoccupied she had a habit of turning it
round and round on her finger.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean,” said Mildred, “to get together all the
wisdom on the tenement house question that is
available in New York and Brooklyn, and see what
the consensus of opinion is; and I am going to
have my amanuensis take notes for future reference.
You know I have some coöperative theories
of my own in regard to the matter, and I wish to
ascertain what these practical workers think of
them.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“Whom have you invited?” I inquired, beginning
to be interested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Professor Felix Adler, for one. He built
those tenements that we saw the other day down on
Cherry Street, you remember, and he is also very
much interested in manual training. Then there
is Mr. Pratt, who founded that great Pratt Institute
in Brooklyn, with all kinds of industrial training
and a free library and reading-room. Then—let
me see—I have invited Mr. Barnard of the
Five Points House of Industry, Mrs. Alice Wellington
Rollins, who wrote ‘Uncle Tom’s Tenement,’
Mr. Charles L. Brace of the Children’s Aid Society,
most of the agents of the model tenement houses
that I have visited, several of the lady visitors in
the charity organizations, and one or two architects.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As it proved, however, not all who were invited
came, but there were enough to comfortably fill our
pretty parlor. There were Jews and Gentiles, radicals
and high-churchmen, all interested in the same
subject, and many of them meeting each other for
the first time.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mildred had chocolate and cakes and fruit served,
and then proceeded to business in the dignified,
quiet way which so well became her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have asked you here this evening,” she said,
“that I may get the benefit of your united wisdom
and experience. I seek enlightenment as to the
best way to solve the problem of the housing of the
poor in a great city. I wish to do something to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>make the conditions of existence a little more bearable
for some of the wretched creatures that I have
been seeing of late in such places as the Mulberry
Street Bend, on Hester, Forsyth, and Cherry
streets, and a hundred other places.</p>

<p class='c005'>“For some years, in connection with the Associated
Charity work of Boston, I have visited poor
families in the alleys of North Street, and have
made myself somewhat familiar with the problems
that are besetting us in the herding together of
enormous numbers of people under conditions that,
I think I am safe in saying, never before existed.
What little I have seen in other cities is as nothing
to what I find here. And it is here in New York,
where I am told you have the most thickly populated
square mile on the globe, and where the dregs
from Castle Garden remain, that I propose to do
something.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As I have been about with your district visitors
and have picked my way among the garbage
barrels and swarming mass of humanity in the
Jewish quarter, on their market day, I have wondered
how it was possible for morality to exist in
the close personal contact and absolute want of privacy
which this lack of space necessitates. Now,
tell me, what is to be done to relieve this condition
of things and permit those little <i><span lang="fr">gamins</span></i> to grow up
decent American citizens? Are things worse or
are they better than they used to be? I hear that
a mint of money is spent in charity, but I hear also
that in the past one of the greatest causes of pauperism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>has been found to be unwise philanthropy,
and the more I look into the question the more perplexed
and uncertain I find myself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What does your experience suggest?” asked
Mildred, turning with one of her winning smiles to
a cheery-faced lady of perhaps fifty years of age,
who sat at her right.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is a pretty hard question to answer,” was
the reply. “I’ve been at work for twenty-five
years down on the East side near the river, and I
am free to say that I don’t see much improvement.
Of course, things are better in some ways; there is
better sanitary inspection than there used to be,
and need enough there is of it too, with these filthy
Italians and Polish Jews who are pouring in here
every week by the thousands. I must say I
haven’t much hope of them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, of course; but haven’t you hope of the
children?” inquired Mildred, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, a little more hope for them, certainly,”
responded the lady somewhat dubiously, with a
sigh that contrasted strangely with her bright,
hopeful face; “but I must say frankly, that the
more I see of the poor, the more hopeless I sometimes
feel and the less able to make generalizations
and give advice. I used to think it a comparatively
simple thing, requiring merely money and
hard work. Ten years ago I could have given you
advice very glibly, but I don’t feel so sure about
anything now; there are so many sides to everything,
and so many exceptions to every rule.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“Of course, good tenement houses are a great
thing, provided you can have a janitor and a housekeeper
to keep them in order. But the best model
tenement house in the world would be completely
ruined if entirely given over to the class of tenants
I know about. They will just as likely as not
throw their ashes and garbage down the waste-pipes,
and pile all their bedding out on the fire-escapes,
blocking them up so as to make them almost
useless in case of a fire. It requires the patience
of Job to deal with such people. They don’t
care for your new improvements, and they don’t propose
to be restrained by any regulations or rules.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As for the model tenement houses that we
have, doubtless they are excellent. But they don’t
as a general thing reach the lowest class of people,
and in any event they are a mere drop in the
bucket. There’s just one consolation about it all,
as I say to myself when I go about,—these people
have never been used to anything better, and they
don’t know how miserable they are.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is just what I think is the worst of it,”
said Mrs. Rollins, as the speaker paused. “The
fact that they don’t know anything better, don’t
expect anything better, don’t want anything better,
is the frightful thing about it. As to whether
things are getting better or not I can’t say, but I
know this, the tenement house has come to stay;
it cannot be eliminated from the modern problem
of living. Thousands of our well-to-do people are
living in flats and suites simply to avoid the burden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>and expense of having to entertain so much company,
and these buildings, like the Spanish flats or
the Dacotah, are really only another kind of tenement
house. As I say, the tenement house has
come to stay. Separate houses for separate families
are going to be fewer and fewer in our large
cities, where land is becoming more and more valuable.
The thing that remains for us to do is to
build with more skill and wisdom, so that while
the separate house must more and more give way,
the home need not be sacrificed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Brewster,” said a gray-bearded man
whose name I did not learn, “as to the question
whether the charities and sanitary improvements of
the city have amounted to anything in the last
twenty-five years, it seems to me it is not well for
us to rely wholly on personal impressions. There
are figures at command which can abundantly
show that in two respects at least—the lessening
of the rates of mortality and the reduction of arrests
for crime—we have made an immense advance
on twenty-five years ago, in spite of the fact
that the population has nearly doubled. Permit
me to state a few facts.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good; this is just what I want,” said Mildred
with keen attention.</p>

<p class='c005'>He continued: “In 1864, when the sanitary examination
of the city was made, some wards were
found to be peopled at the rate of 290,000 persons
to the square mile, while in the most densely populated
part of London the number was less than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>176,000 to the square mile. To show what sanitary
regulations will do, let me say that the number of
deaths in London previous to a good sanitary government
was one in twenty, and in New York one
in thirty-five, while after such regulations the number
in London was reduced to one in forty-five,
and in New York to one in thirty-eight and a half.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We think our tenement houses now are bad
enough, but let me read you a report of the condition
of things in 1866. ‘At this time the cities of
New York and Brooklyn were filled with nuisances,
many of them of years’ duration. The streets
were uncleaned; manure heaps, containing thousands
of tons, occupied piers and vacant lots; sewers
were obstructed; houses were crowded and badly
ventilated and lighted; stables and yards were filled
with stagnant water, and many dark and damp cellars
were inhabited. The streets were obstructed,
and the wharves and piers were filthy and dangerous
from dilapidation. Cattle were driven through
the streets at all hours of the day in large numbers.
Slaughter houses were open to the streets, and were
offensive from the accumulated offal and blood, or
filled the sewers with decomposing animal matter.
Gas companies, shell-burners, and fat-boilers pursued
their occupations without regard to the public
health or comfort, filling the air with disgusting
odors; and roaming swine were the principal scavengers
of the streets and gutters!’</p>

<p class='c005'>“Moreover,” the gentleman continued, “owing
to the general indifference and ignorance concerning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>sanitary construction of houses, tenement houses
used often to be found having on one floor ten or
twelve interior rooms, with no means of ventilation
or light except through other rooms; and at night,
when these rooms were occupied and the doors
closed, one may imagine the amount of poison
which each person was compelled to breathe. Now,
all that has been remedied to a great extent. No
such houses are allowed to be built, and in lodging-houses
there is a wholesome regulation as to the
number of cubic feet of air-space allowed to each
individual. Sanitary inspection is conducted by
competent officials at regular intervals. The public
conscience has been aroused in this matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As I look back thirty-five years, I find that
among the better class of people there is far more
fastidiousness in regard to all matters of personal
cleanliness than there used to be. There are more
bathing facilities, a greater delicacy in manners at
table, a greater tendency to isolation and privacy
in personal matters of the toilet, and so forth, and
therefore among every class of people a better sentiment
in regard to the enforcement of sanitary regulations
than there used to be when I was a boy.
But those who are helping these things, although
many absolutely, are relatively pitifully few. Yet
no one who knows the condition of affairs twenty
years ago can question that an advance has been
made. We are learning to organize charity better,
we are spending our efforts in more profitable directions,
and we are training our public not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>increase pauperism by the old-fashioned, pernicious
methods of indiscriminate giving. In regard to the
lessening of juvenile crime I think Mr. Brace can
give the most valuable opinion of any one present.”</p>

<p class='c005'>All eyes were turned to Mr. Brace, and there was
a hearty hand-clapping as he prepared to speak.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Since 1852,” he said, “the society which I represent
has been doing its best to rescue the little
wanderers of this city from lives of suffering and
degradation. The value of its work is too well
known for me to enlarge upon it. We are met
here this evening to discuss tenement houses, and
I will therefore take the time to make only two or
three statements in reply to Miss Brewster’s inquiry
as to whether the morals of the community have
improved, and whether charitable and reformatory
work is of much value. Now, in spite of the fact
that the overcrowding in the poor quarters is
greater than ever, that the lowest of the European
population are pouring into our city to an alarming
extent, that our municipal government has often
been notoriously corrupt, in spite of all this, I say,
by means of the efforts which have been put forth,
there has been a steady and most satisfactory decrease
in crime during all these years. Allow me to
give you a few figures. In 1859 there were more
than five thousand five hundred commitments for
female vagrancy, and in 1886, notwithstanding the
general increase in population, there were less than
two thousand five hundred commitments for the
same cause. In the eleven years preceding 1886,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the decrease in arrests for drunkenness among
males was just about fifty per cent. I will hand
you a table, Miss Brewster, giving you the report
of juvenile crimes since 1875, and also the Police
record containing the general report for the city,
the details of which you can read at your leisure.
I will simply say now that the net summing up of
these reports shows a remarkable decrease in crime
of all sorts of twelve and a half per cent. This, I
think, will answer your question as to whether, on
the whole, our city is any better.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is another thing to be noticed,” said a
little lady over in the corner. “People of all
classes think more of going into the country and
getting fresh air than they used to. Thousands of
families who thirty years ago would not have spent
two or three weeks in the year out of the city now
think they must have two months at least. They
have come to consider this a necessity for themselves,
and it makes them through sympathy appreciate
a little the needs of the very poor during the
fierce summer heat. The lovely charities of the
Flower Mission, Country Week, and the harbor
excursions have grown out of this sympathy for
others.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I, for one, think that the world is far more
kind and sympathetic than it used to be, in all sorts
of little ways, as is shown by the multiplication
of such societies as the ‘King’s Daughters’ and
‘Lend a Hand’ clubs, by the increased tenderness
with children, and prevention of cruelty to animals.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>I don’t mean to say that people are much happier,
for they have a higher standard and are less content
with objectionable things than they used to be
when I was a child forty years ago. But I for one
do not decry that kind of discontent with existing
bad circumstances. To me it seems to be only the
precursor of reform. I do not believe in encouraging
the poor to be content with their lot. I
think, with Mrs. Rollins, that the worst thing possible
is this fearful apathy toward bad surroundings,
of which one sees so much among our low foreigners.
The first thing to do in Americanizing them
is to make them discontented with living like the
brutes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what is the first step in that direction?”
inquired Mildred, thoughtfully. “Is it more legislation
to regulate and limit this fearful inflow of
more people than we are able to cope with; or is it
a large concerted movement of capitalists to provide
better tenements? Or is it education and
Christianization?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As I hold, it is each and all of these,” said a
blond-haired, keen-eyed young man in the back
part of the room, rising as he spoke and leaning
against the mantel. He spoke in a clear, crisp
way which was pleasant to hear.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Legislation is needed, after we first enforce
the laws which we already have; but it would
hardly be worth while to petition for new ones
when we can make the old but little more than a
dead letter. At present no foreigner can be allowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>by law to land who has not money enough
to support himself for a year; and yet how often is
this law enforced? No; as long as the pressure
of taxation and the burden of a great standing
army exists in every country in Europe, as long as
our unchristian tariff prevents the natural inflow
of foreign products and grinds down the laborers
of the old world, so long shall we be compelled to
face this problem of Americanizing two thirds of
the population of our great cities. We here in
New York live in a foreign city. There are less
than fifteen per cent. of us whose parents were
born in this country and bred in its political, religious,
and social traditions. One doesn’t realize
this in walking down Broadway or Fifth Avenue;
but in some parts of the city where most people do
not often go, one would think himself in Germany,
or Italy, or Poland.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, you ask what is the first step toward
Americanizing this foreign element. <em>I</em> say, education,
Christianity, and better living. There isn’t
much use in trying to teach children when their
stomachs are empty; there is not much use in
goody-goody Sunday-school talk without the discipline
in cleanliness, order, and industry which
the day school alone can compel; neither is there
much use in giving these people palaces to live in
and supplying them with comforts and conveniences,
unless at the same time you bring some
moral power to bear upon them, while also helping
them to a pretty good acquaintance with the three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>R’s. You see, it works both ways. Clean and
wholesome physical surroundings create an opportunity
for mental and spiritual growth, and without
the latter the former would not be appreciated
or preserved.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I quite agree with the last speaker,” said Professor
Adler in his mild, quiet way, contrasting
with the briskness of the blond young man whose
common-sense talk had pleased us. “The supply
of pure air, sanitary regulations, and decent comforts
must be the primary object of the philanthropist
who would solve the problem of the housing
of the poor; but it will avail little, unless it is
invariably accompanied by constant supervision,
helpfulness, and sympathy. Every tenement house
should have a responsible resident agent,—not
a mere perfunctory person who shall issue orders
and collect the rent, but one who in case of sickness
or trouble can give advice and help, and by
living constantly in friendly relations with tenants
can initiate reforms in a wise way. The stubbornness
and conservatism of the ignorant in opposing
what is for their real good is one of the
most surprising things we have to contend with.
One would think, for instance, that a coöperative
grocery store, situated in a tenement house, and
giving good quality at as reasonable prices as could
be obtained elsewhere, would be an inducement to
the average tenant to buy. But so great is the
suspicion that we are trying to take advantage of
them in some way, that they will often prefer to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>go farther and pay more, simply to assert their independence.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do they take kindly to free kindergartens?”
inquired Mildred.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, when they come to understand them; but
the announcement of a kindergarten, free reading-room,
and bath-rooms in connection with a new
tenement house rarely offers much inducement to
the average laborer looking for rooms. But a
large room which can be used in the morning for
kindergarten purposes, and at other times for a
gathering place for clubs and singing-classes, is an
invaluable thing in every large tenement house.
This gives a foothold for all kinds of work to be
conducted by young gentlemen and ladies who desire
to uplift the youth of these neighborhoods.
Gymnastic classes and glee clubs form a sort of
neutral ground where all may meet on a common
level, and where the refinement, intelligence, and
good breeding of those who are willing to give
their services once or twice a week will soon
make itself felt. It is not necessary that they
should directly teach or preach; but if they are
well-bred, kind-hearted people, they will by their
mere tones of voice and their method of managing
things exert a subtle influence which in tune will
give them the power to go further and attempt
other things.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The quickest way to Americanize an ignorant
foreigner is to give him frequent object lessons in
the shape of the best type of American citizen.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“I think I understand you,” said Mildred, “and
it is what I myself thoroughly believe. The model
tenement house question is not merely a question
of brick and stone, ventilation, bath-rooms, and
four per cent.; it is a question largely of providing
the best means for uplifting spiritually, mentally,
and physically these swarming masses. Speaking
of four per cent., let me inquire whether tenement
houses can be considered a good money investment.
Not that I, personally, am anxious to make
money out of them; but I suppose it goes without
saying that anything like this which does not pay
a fair percentage, and is really a charity, in the
end tends to pauperize and is pernicious.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly,” replied Professor Adler; “and not
only that, but most of the poor are too proud to
accept charity in that form, though, inconsistently
enough, they may be quite ready to accept it in
other ways. But anything which savors of an institution
or charity, and that puts them under obligations,
is sure to fail. On the other hand, to
hold out to capitalists the idea that they had better
put their money into tenement houses because
it is a good investment is something I do not like
to do. A man who wishes simply to make money
would tell me that he knows far better methods
than mine, and would consider my advice an impertinence.
But every man, no matter how much
of an egotist he may be, likes to be thought unselfish,
and if I can tell him that here is a means of
doing great good while at the same time he loses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>no money, then he may listen to me. Money
wisely put into tenements can provide for the tenant
far more advantages than he usually has; it
can give light, air, cleanliness, many conveniences
in common with others, and yield to the landlord
four per cent. besides. Some good tenements pay
six per cent., but this is perhaps at a sacrifice of
conveniences to the tenant, or is due to some special
reasons. However, as the security of the investment
is so great, four per cent. may be considered
fair interest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good; now as to the details,” said Mildred in
her practical way. “I want to tell you my scheme,
and then let you criticise it to the utmost. I suppose
I was born with a bump for economy; at all
events, nothing tries me more than the excessive
waste which I have seen around me all my life. I
don’t mean merely waste of money, but waste of
time, waste of energy and effort in every direction.
Of course there is less of the latter here than in the
old world, for here Yankee ingenuity does not have
so hard a fight with prejudice, and every inventor
of a labor-saving machine is crowned with honor.
Still, there is a terrible amount of waste, especially
in women’s work. I will not stop to speak of all
phases of it; but as I have observed men and women
for years, and have seen the suffering from needless
backaches caused by climbing stairs and doing
housework in an unnecessarily hard way, as I have
seen the complexity and endless details of our
modern life crowd out, in the lives of all but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>rich, the leisure which their children should have,
and which they need for their own self-development,
I have racked my brains to see what could
be done to simplify the petty details of modern
housekeeping.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe that we are on the verge of a new era
in this respect. The prejudices of centuries must
give way to the new requirements of a civilization
which will more and more create an urban population,
and also a higher standard of physical comfort.
Now in this, time, strength, and money must
be better conserved, or we shall, as a nation, have
nervous prostration, I fear.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My only solution for this, or for a part of it
at least, seems to me coöperation, so that all shall
get the greatest return for the least outlay. I
don’t mean for a moment that I believe hotel life
or boarding-house life to be the life of the family
of the future. Heaven forbid! That the privacy
and seclusion of the individual and family should
be preserved is imperative. The home is the first
consideration. But that one’s food should be
cooked, or one’s clothes made or washed, inside the
rooms occupied by the family, seems to me no essential
feature of the home, and I am convinced
that where prejudice can be removed, a great gain
would be made by eliminating the first and last, at
least from the home of the city poor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In regard to the value of a common laundry
with set tubs, I think most of you have found
them successful. I have found only one person-an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>attendant in the beautiful Astral flats of Green
Point—who told me that they were considered undesirable,
as tending to encourage gossip and quarreling.
Now the dwellings which I mean to build
are intended for a lower class of people than any
whom I have hitherto found occupying model tenement
houses. In those on Seventy-second Street,
I was told there were many mechanics earning
three to four dollars a day. Such people are not
what I call poor, and I design my houses for people
who earn, at most, only half of that. I want
to give them the greatest possible return for their
money, and at the same time make a fair per cent.
on the capital invested. The income thus derived
I shall devote to the erection of more houses.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I propose to make the buildings fairly fireproof,
with iron staircases and stone-paved halls.
The interior walls will be of painted brick. Upon
the top of the house I propose to have a well-fenced,
well-paved playground, believing that the
roof space which is so rarely utilized in our great
cities may be made of great service in this way.
In most of the tenement houses I find that the
roof is not allowed to be used for anything but
drying clothes, the owners not caring to go to the
extra expense necessary to make it a perfectly safe
place for children. But, if it is all planned in the
beginning, the expense will be comparatively slight,
and the open space thus provided will afford better
air than any interior court, and be, both physically
and morally, a far safer place than the street.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>By a simple arrangement of pulleys the drying
clothes can be elevated between strong, high posts
quite above the heads of the children, so that
their play need not be interrupted. A stout wire
netting can be arranged to keep the clothes from
blowing away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“On the upper floor of the house I shall have
several store-rooms adjoining a freight elevator
and a kitchen. This will be connected with every
floor of the house by speaking-tubes and dumb-waiters,
so that meals can be cooked here for the
whole number of tenants and delivered hot when
ordered. The charge will be simply for the cost
of preparing the food itself and the fuel; and
as everything will be bought by the quantity,
the expense for each individual will be moderate.
I believe that thus, with proper arrangements, and
suiting the food to the tastes of the occupants,
the whole question of the food supply may be
solved, and three women do the work of a hundred.
How does this feature of the house impress
you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>As Mildred paused, three voices exclaimed in
chorus,—</p>

<p class='c005'>“It would never work in the world!” “Perfectly
impracticable!” “They would not like it
at all!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why not?” asked Mildred.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, first of all,” said a man who proved to
be an agent in one of the large model tenement
houses, “what would all those women do if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>take away their work from them? They would
be idle and shiftless, and just spend their time in
gossiping and quarreling. I know ’em.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It seems to me,” said Mildred, rather tartly,
“that if the average poor man’s wife has not enough
to do in washing, ironing, scrubbing, sweeping,
making and mending clothes for a household and
attending to her children, we need not feel any
necessity laid upon us to fill up any spare moment
she may have for herself by an addition of needless
work for work’s sake. I know poor mothers
in Boston who don’t get down so far as the Common
twice a year, who scarcely see a green tree from
one year’s end to another, who never think they
can spare a moment’s time to amuse their children,
and who gladly turn the poor little ones into
the street to get them away from the hot cooking-stove
which occupies the best part of the only
family living-room. It is to such mothers that I
would give a little freedom, and in time they will
find something better to do than quarreling and
gossiping if they live in my tenements.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But they will have to pay a little more for
their food than if they cooked it themselves. The
wages of the cook must be paid, and even a little
more counts,” remonstrated another skeptic.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not at all,” said Mildred, eagerly. “Think of
the immense saving in fuel to begin with. Why,
most of these people, as you know well, buy coal
in small quantities, often by the hodful, paying for
it at an enormous rate when reckoned by the ton,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>to say nothing of the evil of sending children out
along the wharves to pick up dirty barrels and
bits of wood for kindling.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But in winter they would need the fire just
the same for warmth,” said some one.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No; the whole house would have steam heat,
thus making a valuable saving of space as well, by
doing away with the stove and place for fuel.
The halls of the model tenements now are heated
by steam. I estimate that the trifle extra which
would be added to the price of the room and the
food would be no more than, probably not so
much as, what would be spent for food and fuel in
the old way; for the poor that I have known are
the most extravagant people living. They buy a
poor quality of food at high rates, and through
bad cooking and irregularity of living waste and
spoil much that they have.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Besides, I have had another thing in mind,—that
is, the mothers who go out to work by the day
and have to let their children come home from
school to pick up any kind of cold dinner that they
find, and who, so far as my experience goes, invariably
spend every cent they get upon candy and
innutritious cakes bought at the bakery.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is all a charming theory, Miss Brewster,”
said a pale-faced lady with auburn hair, who had
hitherto remained silent; “but I am afraid that
until you have a more enlightened community to
deal with it won’t work. The conservatism, perhaps
one might call it the stupidity, of the lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>classes is something we are fighting against all the
time. Every innovation has to be introduced with
great caution in order not to offend them. Strange
as it may seem, these people who come from lands
where they have been down-trodden, with no privileges
of any sort, stickle more for their rights and
independence, and are far less willing to yield to restrictions
than we. They don’t want to be ‘bossed.’
They want to do as they please, even if they pay
more for it and are not half so well served. The
idea of saving fuel and getting rid of the nuisance
of ash-barrels would not appeal to the low Italians.
They cook their little messes of macaroni over a
few sticks, and would not dream of using the fuel
that an Irishman would require.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let me tell you about a cheap lunch-room that
was started as an experiment some time ago. We
gave good, nutritious food at the lowest cost price,
and what was the result? It remained on our
hands, and we could not sell it, and discovered to
our surprise that the people for whose advantage
we had established it learned that if they waited
until the food was cold and ready to spoil they
could come to the back door and ask for it and
get it for little or nothing. It would really have
been wiser to throw the food away. Yet the very
same people who would do this showed a decided
pride when they suspected any supervision or interference
in their domestic affairs. A coöperative
kitchen was established in one of our tenement
houses as an experiment, that is, a range to be used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>in common, in order to save the fuel and heat in
summer of a fire in each separate room. But no
one liked to use it. Each woman was afraid of
interfering or being interfered with.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naturally enough,” said Mildred; “and anything
that should tend to mix up families, where the
yielding of personal preferences and ‘taking turns’
is involved, would probably fail so long as human
nature remains human nature. I do not propose
anything of that sort, you see.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think myself,” said Professor Adler, “that
the idea is thoroughly good, and if cautiously and
wisely carried out would be a success. I should
like to see the experiment tried. I have all my
life been preaching coöperation, not only for the
poor, but for ourselves as well, but with small success.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The chief objection, I suppose,” said Mildred,
“is, that when food is cooked in large quantities it
never tastes so good. In time everything seems to
get a sort of boarding-house flavor, and individual
tastes cannot be consulted as in one’s own home.
This may be made an objection by the rich, but
that a fastidiousness about a flavor should prevent
people from trying coöperation, who have all they
can do to keep soul and body together, seems to me
more than ridiculous.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is more than ridiculous, and I for one have
faith that people can be taught to see it,” said the
blond young man with the clear, crisp speech.
“The people who have lived in the model tenement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>houses have already learned to use dumb-waiters,
speaking-tubes, set tubs, ash-shutes, and the like,
and have seen the advantages of these modern conveniences.
Now, with patience on our part and a
painstaking explanation of your scheme, I think that
they could be led to see the saving in time, fuel,
space, money, and quality of food as well as the increased
variety of food and cleanliness incident to
an arrangement such as you propose, and which I
heartily hope you will carry out. The thing to do,
as Octavia Hill in her work in London has wisely
taught us, is to make sure that we put in the right
sort of men and women to manage such a place.
As she once said, ‘We have more model tenements
than we know how to take care of. My present
work is to train women who will go down and
oversee them.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“If, beside the man who is employed to attend
to the business part of it and to see that the sanitary
condition is good, you will also put in one or
two nice American women who will look after the
families in a friendly way, giving suggestions and
advice with tact, and carefully explaining the advantages
of improvements, I will vouch for the success
of the experiment. If some object, there are
enough people of common sense in the city to fill
one house at least.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It seems to me,” said one speaker, “that we
ought to be careful about talking or even allowing
ourselves to think of those whom we call the ‘lower
classes’ as being essentially different from ourselves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>They are ignorant, of course, and dreadfully
shiftless, some of them, but they have the
same instincts and affections as we, and I for one
respect their individuality and their privacy as I
would our own. I shouldn’t like to ask them to do
anything I wouldn’t do myself under similar circumstances.
If <em>we</em> aren’t ready for coöperation,
how can we expect them to be?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ask nothing of any one,” replied Mildred,
“which I would not be glad to do myself under the
same conditions, or under better conditions. We
are learning to coöperate in a thousand ways of
which our grandfathers never dreamed. Under
the pressure of new duties and interests which our
age has brought with it, we are learning to eliminate
useless individual work where combined work
is better. The law of reciprocity is the divine law.
Wasteful individual effort belongs to the age of
savagery. Communism, the mingling of families,
and absence of personal privacy can never I am
convinced be tolerated by civilized people; but coöperation
with one’s fellows in harnessing up the
forces of nature to subserve our material interests
and leave man more free for the development of
his higher nature, seems to me the only rational
thing for rational beings. Any reluctance to see
and accept this seems to me the result of prejudice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should put it even a little stronger than that,”
said Professor Adler, gently. “Under every objection
which has been presented to me by the friends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>with whom I have for years been laboring in this
very line of effort, I have felt that there was not
mere prejudice but a real, unconscious selfishness.
All objections like the one you mention are mere
matters of detail which could be properly adjusted,
and the freedom of the wife from all petty details
that eat up the greater part of her life ought to
more than compensate for the slight sacrifice of
feeling involved in doing an unaccustomed thing.
I believe that we shall gradually come to it; and
meanwhile our boarding-houses and hotels will
shelter larger and larger numbers of women driven
from housekeeping by the weight of domestic cares.
They will have lost their home in losing their
cook!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Dear Alice</span>: What an age it seems since I left
Boston and exchanged the peace and quiet of my
dear old attic room for all this turmoil and whirl of
excitement! I have done more thinking in the last
two months than ever before in my life, and sometimes
I feel as though every idea had been squeezed
out of my brain. If it were not that I insist upon
getting some hours every week for a canter in the
park, I fear I should be in a state of nervous collapse.
However, I am beginning to see my way
clear, and hope to get away in a month or so and
be off to the West. Then when I get a conscience
tolerably clear I shall run riot like a school-boy
out of school.</p>

<p class='c005'>Just now I am buried deep in tenement house
problems. I have had two or three conclaves of
all the wiseacres I could get together, and I have
been considering their criticisms and suggestions,
until now the details of my scheme are pretty
nearly complete, and I sign the papers with my
architect and builder to-night.</p>

<p class='c005'>You know about the plan for coöperative cooking
which I used to discourse upon to you to your
infinite amusement. Well, half of the people here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>opposed it at first just as you did. They said, for
one thing, that no one under heaven would be able
to provide the kind of food that would suit all
tastes. There would be Jews who would want to
have meat killed after their own fashion; the Italians
would want horrid messes of garlic; the Irish
would find fault if they didn’t have the finest
white bread and the strongest of tea, and not a
blessed one of them would eat oatmeal, the coarse
cereals, nutritious soups, or any of the suitable
things that they ought to eat.</p>

<p class='c005'>All of which is more or less true, as I had wit
enough to know myself beforehand; but I don’t
mean to let it daunt me. I shall let all my tenants
have an Atkinson kerosene stove in their rooms, if
they wish to pay for it, and on this they can do an
endless amount of cooking at a trifling cost for
fuel, and a great saving of space as well as of heat
in summer.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have engaged one of the graduates of Mrs.
Lincoln’s cooking school to take my first kitchen
in charge. Meantime, until the buildings are
ready, I am going to send her to study the system
of marketing and cooking for hotels; also the kinds
of food which each nationality likes, and the methods
of its preparation.</p>

<p class='c005'>The kitchen will be arranged under her special
supervision. She will engage her own assistants
and be the responsible head. She will have a
schedule of cooked dishes, with prices of each displayed
on a bulletin in the corridors. Special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>dishes will be cooked by request, and orders for
food can be sent in the day before. Of course at
first there may be a little waste until she gets familiar
with the people and can anticipate their wants;
but she is a smart Yankee girl, and has a good-natured,
merry way with her which I am sure will
win recognition. I have told her to make it her
first point to please the people, and when that is
accomplished she can gradually teach them to
drink milk instead of tea, and to eat brown bread
instead of soda crackers.</p>

<p class='c005'>One objection which was brought up was that
children would have no chance to learn cooking,
never seeing their mothers cook; but I said, that
not one woman in ten of those I have in mind
knows how to cook either in a cleanly or economical
way. They have but little variety in their cooking,
moreover, and I thought the loss of the instruction
which might be imparted would be largely
counterbalanced by the knowledge which would be
gained as to what well-cooked food tasted like.</p>

<p class='c005'>The <i><span lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> of getting the food will be
something like this. At half-past six, Biddy Flanigan,
who has to go out scrubbing at seven o’clock,
will deposit a dime with her teapot and an empty
dish in the dumb-waiter; she will call up through
the speaking-tube that she wants tea, fried potatoes,
and three rolls; and in about seventy seconds
the dish full of potatoes done to a turn, and not
soaked in fat, and a pot full of tea will be at her
elbow. From these and the nice home-made rolls,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>neither burned nor sour nor underdone, she and
little Patsy and Maggie will have a hot breakfast.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Maggie will wash the dishes with the hot
water running at the sink; there will have been no
ashes to dump, or clinkers to pick out; no fuel to
be brought, or fire made; and Biddy can put on
her hood and depart, knowing that the children will
not open all the draughts and waste the coal, or set
themselves on fire, or let the fire go out, and come
home from school to a dinner of cold scraps, with
the necessity of building up the fire again at night.
For with a nickel in the dumb-waiter at noon, and
a tin can containing two big bowls full of hot soup,
the children will be well provided for.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have some little plans for the arrangements of
rooms which I hope will work well. The beds of
the tenement houses have always been a great
trouble to me. Of all clumsy and unsanitary arrangements
for sleeping when one is obliged to
sleep with four or five others in a small room, ordinary
bedsteads seem to me the worst. Now in
order to introduce all the improvements that I
want, I am obliged to economize space. The people
must be crowded together, there is no other
way out of that; so, for the children, I mean to put
up single beds, berth-fashion, over each other.
Strong iron sockets fastened to the wall will hold
an iron frame on which a little mattress with bedclothes
will be strapped. In the daytime these
will be turned up, one under the other, and hooked
against the wall, out of the way, and a neat little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>curtain fastened to the upper one will hang down
and conceal both as if they were a set of hanging
shelves. At night the youngster in the upper
berth will be protected from all danger of falling
out by two or three leather straps fastened on to
the upper part of the berth and hooked firmly to
the lower edge of the framework. I have thought
all the details out one by one as various objections
were made to my scheme.</p>

<p class='c005'>I think this plan a fine solution for the dirt and
vermin question. Besides, the mattresses, being
so small, could be very much more easily aired and
turned than if they were larger. But an agent,
to whom I explained it, protested, saying she
wouldn’t encourage such an idea at all. “People
ought to live properly, in regular fashion, and not
get used to putting up with any such makeshifts as
that. It wouldn’t be living naturally.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You old bigot!” said I inwardly, “your grandmother,
I suppose, would have protested against
sleeping-cars and elevators and dumb-waiters as
being unnatural and artificial!”</p>

<p class='c005'>I am amazed every day to see how densely
stupid some sensible people are. I know a Frenchwoman
who has always slept at home on a bed four
feet high, canopied and enshrouded with curtains.
It is half a day’s work to make it, and she feels out
in the cold and all forlorn when put into one of
our little, open, low, brass bedsteads. I suppose
she would think it quite as unhomelike and as demoralizing
in its tendency as my agent thought my
berth beds would be.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>The other day I explained the idea to a poor
woman in a tenement house, who with the greatest
difficulty was trying to sweep under two good-sized
bedsteads in a tiny room. At first she did not seem
to comprehend, but when she did, she smiled and
nodded and said, “I like that, Mees; easy to sweep;
children no kick each other all time; my children
sleep four in one bed—too much kick and cry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I have thought of another thing, that is, of having
low, stationary settees made in suitable places
against the wall, and having the seat a cover which
would turn up on hinges, showing space underneath
where clothes and all sorts of things could be kept
out of sight, instead of being put into trunks or
left to lie around in an untidy way. I shall have
no closets, as I find that space can be better saved
and cleanliness more readily enforced by building
stationary wardrobes, each with a drawer underneath
and shelves above extending to the ceiling.
Closets, I find, are rarely swept.</p>

<p class='c005'>On these shelves, which can be protected by a curtain,
things not in frequent use can be laid away,
and every inch of space to the ceiling utilized. I
know you will not approve of this. You think
closets are a <i><span lang="la">sine qua non</span></i>; all of which is well
enough if you are dealing with people who are sure
to keep them swept clean, and where room is not so
precious. But in this case I am planning to economize
space to the utmost, and at the same time
give the number of hooks for hanging clothes that
there is in the ordinary closet.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>The rooms are to be only seven feet high, thereby
saving much space and making it possible for me
to put on another story to the building. Without
this, by the closest planning, I could not afford all
the conveniences that I want and get my four per
cent. interest, which, for the success of the experiment,
I feel bound to make.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course these low-studded rooms would give
too little air were it not that I have taken extraordinary
pains about the ventilation. I have been
using all my feminine ingenuity to devise all possible
means to provide the greatest amount of comfort
and convenience for the smallest possible
amount of money and space. Understand that I
am aiming to provide a decent home for the very
poorest, who cannot afford to pay more than five
dollars a month for rent. I mean to give them as
much room as they have now in their dirty, dark
alleys and attics, and in addition to that, warmth,
pure air, cleanliness, and the saving of countless
steps.</p>

<p class='c005'>I find my architects strangely unsuggestive about
all this; they have not enough imagination to put
themselves in the place of a tired ignorant woman
who has to spend all her life in two rooms with her
husband and four or five untidy, restless children.</p>

<p class='c005'>Knowing how much afraid of the dark many of
my North End people used to be, and remembering
how they used to keep a lamp burning all
night in their sleeping-rooms, where the windows
were shut tight, I have planned to have the upper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>eight inches of the walls of the room bordering on
the hall, of glass, which can be opened like a transom,
to admit air and much light at night from the
lights in the hall, which I shall myself provide. I
mean also to have in every room, fastened against
the wall, a stationary table that can be put up or let
down like an ordinary table-leaf.</p>

<p class='c005'>I am going to have some experienced woman
oversee all these little details, for I never yet saw
a builder who could not learn a great deal from a
practical housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the basement there are to be bath-rooms and
a barber’s shop, while in some part of the building
I shall have a large room which can be divided by
sliding-doors. One part shall be a nursery, where
mothers who want to go out can leave their children
in good charge for a trifling fee, and the other
half of the room shall be used as a kindergarten.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the evening these rooms will be occupied by
the grown people for club meetings and a reading-room.
When desired, both rooms can be thrown
together for a lecture or entertainment.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have in mind sewing schools and gymnastic
classes and all sorts of good things, for which this
will be the centre.</p>

<p class='c005'>I am more and more convinced that the quickest
way to revolutionize whatever needs revolutionizing
in this world is to get at the hearts and souls of
people. Open a man’s heart, give him an idea, in
other words, convert him, and self-respect, industry,
and good manners will soon appear.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>I think I have found just the right man and
woman to help me make my scheme feasible. They
are a couple about fifty years old, Pennsylvania
Quakers, whose daughter has just been graduated
from Professor Adler’s kindergarten training school,
and who is bubbling over with zeal to begin her
work. All three are to live in the building and
give their whole time to the work that may be
needed, each one having his or her separate department
to attend to, and being responsible for everything
in that department. For all this a good
salary will be paid to each of the three.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have found that my original plan has grown
on my hands, and as it is often easier to do a thing
on a large scale than on a small one, I have decided
to put up four large buildings around a hollow
square, each one to contain one hundred sets of
tenements of from one to four rooms. Each house
will accommodate perhaps four or five hundred
people. Most of the suites will contain two rooms
suitable for a family of four. But I shall have
also many single rooms for bachelors, there being a
good demand for them, I find.</p>

<p class='c005'>You know my enthusiasm for our Puritan history.
Behold my opportunity to indulge my taste
in that direction! I am going to christen these
hobbies of mine, so long a dream, now so soon to
be materialized, by bestowing upon them some
good old names that ought never to be forgotten.
These four are to be called the “Pilgrim Homes.”
One will be named Scrooby, another Leyden, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Plymouth, and one the Mayflower. If these prove
successful I shall have four more, named Bradford,
Brewster, Carver, and Winslow. However, I must
not romance, for that perhaps will be far in the
future.</p>

<p class='c005'>You have no idea of the endless details I have
had to consider. I have been over every single
model tenement I could find in New York and
Brooklyn, which is not saying much, for there are
not many. Now, although not a stone is yet laid,
I feel as if a load had rolled off my shoulders and
the thing were nearly complete.</p>

<p class='c005'>I shall watch with the greatest anxiety the outcome
of this experiment. If it can be shown, as I
think it can, that the lowest poor can be comfortably
housed at the prices which they now pay for their
wretched slums, and if it can be demonstrated, as
I think it can, that health and happiness increase
and vice decreases in proportion to the opportunity
which is offered for decent living, then I shall be
ready to devote a goodly number of my millions to
what seems to me about the best use that can be
made of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>As soon as it can be fully proved just what needs
to be done, if a state or city loan can be obtained,
I mean to try to persuade some of these wealthy
men and women whom I have been meeting of late
to join with me and engage in the work of tenement house
reform on a gigantic scale. There is no good
reason why the crying evils which now exist should
be perpetuated another year. Since planning all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>this I have been greatly interested to learn of what
Glasgow has recently been doing in this direction;
buying up and destroying a mass of vile old rookeries,
and building sanitary homes for the poor in
place of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is money enough, brains enough, and good
will enough in this city to abolish these hideous
conditions of life by which thousands of lives are
wrecked every year. I am very doubtful about
much state socialism; but municipal socialism to
this extent seems to me the only rational thing in
view of the present evils. A century hence we
shall look back with wonder that our mania for individualism
and dread of governmental interference
should have led us to tolerate these things a day.
I was never more convinced of anything than of
this, and never more terribly in earnest about anything
in my life. Meanwhile my agents are buying
up and cleansing some of the worst old tenement
houses in the city, and I am searching in every direction
for the right person to put in charge of
them. I find that this is the most important feature
of it all. There must be constant, tireless supervision,
and I find that it really pays to give one
good tenant his rent free on condition that he keep
the building clean and orderly. He must, of course,
be one who has enough moral power to enforce
all necessary rules.</p>

<p class='c005'>These details must sound very prosaic to you,
I fear, in comparison with all the delightful things
which you are studying; but just at present I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>finding the subject of dumb-waiters and ash-shoots
quite as fascinating as I ever used to find Correggios
or cryptogamia.</p>

<p class='c005'>By the way, I am going to see a beautiful private
car which is to be sold. I am thinking of buying
it and taking aunt Madison and some delightful
people whom I know on a trip to the Yellowstone
Park and Puget Sound this summer. What do
you say to joining us? By the time you have finished
at the Annex you will be ready to drop, and
will be quite unfit to think of getting up your
trousseau. Tell that impatient young professor
that he must wait for three months, and give you a
chance to know how sweet it is to get a love-letter
when it comes three thousand miles....</p>

<p class='c005'><em>Dear Sir</em>,—Your letter has come to hand with
the inclosed deed for the eight lots on Huntington
Avenue, each twenty-three by one hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>I will now write you in detail about the buildings
which I wish to put upon those lots. I want
you to understand my plans exactly, together with
my reasons for them, as I shall ask you to take the
responsibility of carrying them out.</p>

<p class='c005'>I want to try an experiment that I have long
had in mind. I hope to have it pay a fair per
cent. and at the same time serve as a hint toward
the solution of some of the difficulties in the problems
of modern housekeeping.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>For the last twenty years we have been blundering
our way toward better methods of meeting the
exigencies of our modern city life, but with indifferent
success.</p>

<p class='c005'>However, one thing is certain. In our great
cities, where land is growing more and more expensive,
and where people are swarming in constantly
increasing numbers, building their houses higher
and higher into the air, something must be done to
readjust the methods of living, if life is to remain
anything but drudgery to a large majority of wives
and mothers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The modern system of “flats” is a step in the
right direction, but thus far it has meant cramped
quarters, great expense, and many disadvantages,
and I am convinced that it is a long way from
being the city home of the future.</p>

<p class='c005'>What I propose is to put up some houses where
all the rooms in each suite of apartments shall be
on the same floor, but which shall in no other particular
resemble any “flats” that I have seen.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have found none where the rooms were spacious
and all directly lighted and ventilated from
the outer air, unless they were at a price quite beyond
the income of a man who must live on three
thousand dollars’ salary. Even the best I have
seen, although they are elegantly frescoed and finished,
are sure to have some small dark rooms, and
give much less good space for living purposes than
a house bearing the same rental.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now I think there is no reason for this,—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>is to say, no necessary reason; nothing more in
fact than that the demand for “flats” exceeds the
supply, and landlords make more on an investment
in that direction.</p>

<p class='c005'>The never ceasing trouble with servants, the burden
of entertaining company, the fearful strain of
the stairs incident to living in a house where there
are only two good rooms on a floor,—all these and
other things are more and more compelling people
of moderate means either to board or live in a
“flat,” where one servant can do the work for
which, in an ordinary house, two would be required.</p>

<p class='c005'>I think the continual increase of boarding-houses
marks a sign of decadence in American social and
home life, and yet I do not blame delicate women
for longing for freedom from the details of work,
which is often done at a great disadvantage, and for
immunity from the back-breaking stairs and other
things that are the cause of so much invalidism.</p>

<p class='c005'>Seeing these domestic problems and the wear
and tear of the nervous system contingent on the
ordinary methods of city housekeeping, I have determined
to try in this experiment to see if for a
moderate cost, say nine or ten hundred dollars
rental, it may not be possible to supply a family
with twelve good-sized rooms all on one floor, and
with the back yard of a size which is usual to an
ordinary house.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_152.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>
<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_153.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>One great objection to the ordinary flat is the
absence of a back yard where clothes can be dried,
and children can play. Families with children find
but little freedom and comfort in the ordinary flat,
and I propose to remedy this in the simplest way
in the world,—at least, it seems perfectly simple
and feasible to me. If the architect you engage
makes any objections to the scheme, let me know
what they are.</p>

<p class='c005'>Taking the eight lots which you have purchased,
each one hundred feet deep, let us devote say sixty
feet to the back yards. This will admit of flowerbeds,
and a little playground, a very important
item with a mother of young children. These dimensions
are the same as those of hundreds of
South End lots and houses.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then there will be left for the building of the
eight homes an area of eight lots, each forty feet
deep and twenty-three feet wide.</p>

<p class='c005'>According to our ordinary wasteful system in
the building of houses vertically there would be
eight sets of stone steps, eight doors and lobbies,
and allowing four stories to each house, there would
be four halls and three staircases, one over the
other, in each of the eight houses. Each hall
would involve more or less expense in carpeting,
much time in sweeping and keeping clean; and beside,
much physical energy would be wasted in simply
getting from dining-room to parlor and from
parlor to bedroom.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now it seems to me that instead of building these
eight houses side by side vertically, like so many
bricks set up on end, we can do much better.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>We can abolish seven of our doorsteps and entrance
ways and use one entrance for all, making
it thereby much handsomer, and, if we choose,
seven times more expensive. Then instead of eight
times three flights of stairs we shall have simply
three, one over the other, in a broad central hall
which will run from the street to the back yard,
having four tenements on either side of it, one tenement
for each story. The floors separating the
tenements will be made as impervious to sound as
the partitions in houses built in the usual vertical
fashion. The central hall can be divided into two
parts: a front hall containing a passenger elevator
and a handsome flight of stairs, and a back hall
with another flight of stairs and another elevator,
the latter for servants and freight. With the
same amount of money that would have been required
for building and carpeting the extra stairs,
these halls and staircases can be made handsomer
and absolutely fireproof. On the top story, instead
of the inconvenient ladder and trap-door leading
to the roof, which is usual in our vertically built
tenements, there can be a comfortable staircase,
covered at the point where it reaches the roof and
giving exit through a door upon the roof, which can
be thoroughly guarded by a parapet or iron fence,
thus affording a safe playground for children.</p>

<p class='c005'>This will cost something, of course, but no more
I think than would be expended in the ordinary,
wasteful method of building to which we resort at
present.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Now perhaps you will say that with the exception
of the back yards this is not different from the
ordinary apartment hotel; but wait a bit. What
I propose to do is to give to each person a suite of
rooms equal in cubical contents to what he would
have had in his vertical four-story house, and I
shall arrange these rooms so that he shall have a
frontage on the street, not of twenty-three feet,
but of ninety-two feet minus ten feet which he will
allow for the central hall. As his neighbor across
the hall will have the same frontage and also allow
ten feet for the hall, the latter, you see, will be a
spacious apartment twenty feet in width.</p>

<p class='c005'>Think of a flat having eighty-two feet of front,
and with a set of four back yards at the rear of
each home, which is an area of sixty by eighty-two
feet! To be sure each one cannot use all that area.
He will have only one fourth of it for his special
use, but it will be worth something to have all that
space ostensibly his own, and the outlook a little
different from each room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course your first question will be as to how
these yards are to be reached.</p>

<p class='c005'>My first purpose is to have these eight families
who dwell under the same roof use nothing but
their halls and staircases in common. So in the
basement each family shall have a space at the rear
of the house, twenty-three feet in width, each having
its own exit into its own yard from the laundry
and store-rooms which will be situated there. In
the front part of the basement, where in the average
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Boston house the coal and furnace are usually
found, will be the heating appliances for the whole
building, and heat will be provided in the different
stories as it is in the ordinary hotel.</p>

<p class='c005'>There will be speaking-tubes, of course, connecting
each laundry with its kitchen above, so that
the mistress on the fourth floor can communicate
with her Bridget in the laundry, and the only disadvantage
will be that once a week the Bridget
living on the top story will have to descend four
flights in the elevator to reach her laundry instead
of running down one flight of stairs, as she would
do in the house of the ordinary type.</p>

<p class='c005'>Although I prefer to leave the arrangement of
rooms in the suites to the taste of the architect, I
will inclose a plan—the simplest possible one
which, so far as I know, will be thoroughly convenient.
The only objection to it that I can discover
is, that it is rather stiff and monotonous; but,
as the same thing must be said of our houses as at
present constructed, I do not think this a very formidable
objection. However, I send a second plan,
which will show how it is possible to introduce considerable
variety in the arrangement of rooms. In
this, as you see, the parlor is placed at the end of
the hall, and is thirty-eight feet long, being lighted
at both ends. If it should be thought best, half of
the suites, <em>i. e.</em>, the four on one side of the hall,
can be built after this second plan.</p>

<p class='c005'>The central passage-way running between the
rooms in each suite will receive light through transoms and glass doors, and will be lighter than the
halls in the average city house.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_156.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>As the kitchen does not communicate with this
central passage-way, the odors of cooking will not
be so likely to permeate the house as they usually
do in the average Boston house with a basement
dining-room.</p>

<p class='c005'>If I have made myself clear, I think you will
see that, according to this extremely simple plan
of construction, the chief advantages of the average
flat and the average separate block house may
be combined, and the disadvantages of each nearly
eliminated.</p>

<p class='c005'>The care of the sidewalk, stairs, central hall, and
the management of the heating apparatus, will be
in the charge of a janitor, as is customary in the
ordinary apartment hotel, thus almost doing away
with the work of one servant in each family. In
addition to the great advantage of having all the
rooms on one floor, these rooms will be larger and
more airy than in the ordinary block house. Then,
too, they will not only be more in number than
those in the average flat, but they will be more
than in the vertical house of the same cubical contents.
For the space heretofore devoted to stairs
can now be utilized for living-rooms, and by simply
opening the doors and windows a draught of air
can sweep straight through from front to back of
the house. There will be neither dark rooms nor
rooms opening into a dismal brick air-well, as in
most of our modern flats, and, consequently, none
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>of that cramped, confined feeling that one always
experiences when going into their tiny rooms which
seem designed for a family of three members only,
and where children have no right to be.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now I propose to offer this horizontal dwelling,
with its eighty-two feet front, and its yard at the
back, with all its economy of space and expense
and physical exertion, for <em>precisely the same rental</em>
that the vertical house with its twenty-three feet of
front would cost.</p>

<p class='c005'>And, as I want permanent tenants, and desire to
make them practically the same offer as a sale of
the property would be, you may give, to any one
who desires it, a lease for fifteen or twenty years.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doubtless before that time has expired we shall
come to see that our methods of living must be
modified still more, and separate kitchens and laundries
will be relegated to the country, while some
system of coöperation will come into vogue in our
cities. If so, such a house as I propose to build can
be easily modified to suit the new order of things.
The kitchens above could be metamorphosed into
bedrooms, and part of the space in the basement
turned into a cooking centre for all the families.</p>

<p class='c005'>If this experiment should prove a success,—and
I can see no reason now why it should not,—this
will be but the beginning of what I intend to
do on a large scale. I think I can do no better
service for the hurried, overworked wives and mothers
of our great cities, than to simplify and lighten
the burdens of housekeeping, by adding to their
comfort without adding to their expense.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>I want very little frescoing and gilding in these
houses, but there must be fire-escapes at the rear,
and every device for convenience that is available.</p>

<p class='c005'>In regard to their outward appearance I have
but one suggestion to make. I should like to have
the windows very broad and very low. It has always
seemed to me ridiculous to note the pains
which is taken to cut a hole in the wall and then
immediately cover up two thirds of it in the most
elaborate manner with lambrequins and two or
three sets of curtains, all of which are never raised
above the middle sash except when the servant
washes the glass. If it is desirable to admit a little
subdued light near the top of the room, this might
be done by a few panes of stained or ground glass,
which would not be covered by a curtain. On the
exterior the bricks or stone, arranged in the form
of an arch over each window, would add much to
the beauty of effect.</p>

<p class='c005'>If a window were five feet wide by three and a
half high, the top being no more than six and a
half feet from the floor, the curtain question would
be somewhat simplified and our rooms made sunnier
and more beautiful. However, I leave this to
the architect to decide.</p>

<p class='c005'>You will, I think, get my idea from the accompanying
sketches.</p>

<p class='c008'>In achieving spiritual emancipation the mind must pass from
prescription to conscious reason, from mere faith to knowledge.
There must be nothing lost in the transition, only a gain in the
form of science to what was before held in the form of faith and
tradition. But this transition is the most painful one in history,
although its results are the most glorious.—<span class='sc'>Wm. T. Harris</span>,
LL. D.</p>

<p class='c007'>One evening Mildred and I had prepared for
bed, and in our dressing-gowns were sitting cosily
before our open wood fire, watching the flames
dance and flicker and cast weird shadows on the
wall. It had been a hard day, the morning having
been spent in writing and dictation and in examining
a half bushel of mail matter; the afternoon we
had spent in visiting tenement houses and industrial
schools in Brooklyn.</p>

<p class='c005'>After dinner, however, I had beguiled Mildred
into a merry hour over some dashing Schubert
duets, for music never failed to rest and soothe her.
Then, turning the lights down and drawing the <i><span lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i>
before the red glow of the firelight, we fell to
talking, indulging in many reminiscences of childish
pranks and school-girl sentimentality.</p>

<p class='c005'>I had been bred outside of New England, and
our lives had been wholly unlike. Perhaps it was
because we were so very unlike in many things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>that we were more and more drawn to each other
day by day, finding ever new delight in exploring
each other’s history and thoughts.</p>

<p class='c005'>I had seen more of the world, in a certain way,
than Mildred,—that is, more of society, in Philadelphia,
Baltimore, and Washington. The leisurely,
easy-going life of a people to whom New
England ideas and “isms” were unknown had been
the limits of my social, and Presbyterianism and
Episcopacy the limits of my spiritual, horizon. I
had scarcely dreamed of the existence of any other
way of looking at life among people in good society.</p>

<p class='c005'>A brisk canter on my red roan, with a gay company
of young people, a good dinner party, plenty
of bouquets and dancing and young men, with now
and then a would-be-serious talk with some of the
more studiously-minded of them apropos of German
poetry or Victor Hugo,—this life I had
known all about, and but little of any other.</p>

<p class='c005'>However, eight months previously, when reverses
of fortune had cast my fate in Salem, Massachusetts,
among a family of Unitarians who had
been old-time abolitionists, and were now woman
suffragists and zealous reformers in every direction,
my conception of life had enlarged a little, and I
was prepared not to be amazed at this radical,
bookish Boston girl who upset all my previous theories
of what a charming woman should be.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was charming; no one who had seen her
sitting there, in her loose gown of a delicate rose
color, her dark wavy hair falling around her shoulders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>as she gazed steadily into the glowing embers,
her fine features outlined by the firelight, but
would have thought her so. We had been laughing
heartily over some droll accounts of my first
New England experiences and the horror which I
had aroused in some precise old maids by my frivolity,
while I had been equally horrified by their
radical theology. I thought that it was wicked for
them to read Renan, and they thought it sinful for
me to wear French corsets and moderately high
heels.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a time Mildred and I began to talk of love
and lovers, as girls will. I say “girls,” though I
was six-and-twenty and she my senior. But in
New England, where late marriages are the rule
and not the exception, the term “girls,” as I have
discovered, has an indefinite application.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mildred, were you never in love?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>I shouldn’t have dared quite so much as that,
only somehow she had invited my confidence, and I
had told her all about my love affairs. I couldn’t
tell whether she blushed or not, for the firelight
glowed on her face. At first I thought that she
was offended, for she waited a minute before she
answered, and we listened to the rain coming in
great gusts against the window pane, and the omnibuses
rattling over the paved street below.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mildred nestled a little closer to the fire and adjusted
her cushions. Then she said slowly, as she
stretched out her slender fingers before the blaze,
“Why, yes, I suppose I really was in love, though
I didn’t know it at the time.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“Good heavens, Mildred, not with Mr. Dunreath!”
I cried; “you told me you never really
cared for him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, not with Mr. Dunreath,” replied Mildred
quickly, and throwing her head back she clasped
her hands over her knee, swaying back and forth
in the firelight. Then she stopped again. I asked
no more questions, for there was a look in her eyes
and a droop to the sensitive mouth which meant I
knew not what. Was it possible that this woman,
who seemed so enthusiastically absorbed in her
plans and so cheerful and gay, was really carrying
about with her a secret heart-ache? I had watched
her curiously as we had been in society together,
and had been amused at her absolute lack of coquetry
and matter-of-fact way of talking with gentlemen,
and, on the other hand, at her semi-consciousness
that she must try not to say too much
about her theories and hobbies, and to “learn to
talk small talk,” as she said. I, who had had my
fill of small talk, and whom the late years were beginning
to teach some serious lessons, liked much
better her simplicity and unusual earnestness about
things. Her bookishness, too, which at first I had
rather dreaded, did not mean pedantry or dullness.
She had read but few books, she told me; far less
than I. She once showed me in her diary her list
of books for the past year. There were only six:
Plato’s “Republic,” “Wilhelm Meister,” Stanley’s
“History of the Jews,” Thackeray’s “Newcomes,”
Henry George’s “Progress and Poverty,”
and a volume of Fichte.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“I like to be acquainted with the best people,”
she once said; “there is no reason why one should
put up with the second-rate ones when one can
have the best.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But it is not every one who can get the best society,”
said I, not understanding in the least what
she meant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Every one who can read can have the best
friends of all ages,” she replied. And they were
her friends. But I am digressing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will tell you all about it,” said Mildred, with
her eyes still fixed on the coals. “There is no reason
why I should not, though I never told any one
before, and I have hardly acknowledged it to myself.
I think I was in love; yes, I think I really
was—in love.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It happened in this way. I had gone down to
the Fitchburg station to take the early morning
train for Concord. By the way, were you ever at
Concord?” she asked abruptly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What?” I answered, “Concord, New Hampshire?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, our own Massachusetts Concord; the Concord
of Emerson and Hawthorne and Thoreau and
the Alcotts. I had been there but once before, but
since that time it has been a sort of Mecca of mine,
and I have made many a pilgrimage there.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was going out to the Concord School of Philosophy,
not, however, for any special reason. I
didn’t know and didn’t care to know anything
about philosophy, but I thought it might be fun to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>see for once the long-haired men and short-haired
women congregate and talk, as the papers said,
about the ‘thisness of the then and the whichness
of the where.’ Besides, I wanted to visit Hawthorne’s
grave. I was full of his romances then.</p>

<p class='c005'>“At the station I met my bosom-friend Julia
Mason.  ‘How fortunate!’ she exclaimed. ‘Here
is my cousin, bound for the Summer School, too.
You must philosophize together.’ She introduced
us to each other, and then hastened to take her
own train, while the young man and I made our
way together to the express train for Concord.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He pleased my fancy at once. I was just at
the age when a girl always sees a possible lover
in every handsome young man whom she chances
to know. Not that the thought occurred to me
then, for he was far from being the ideal lover
whom I had dreamed of marrying. My lover must
combine all the graces of an Alcibiades with the
virtues of a Bayard, a knight <i><span lang="fr">sans peur et sans
reproche</span></i>, with classic features, curling locks, and a
voice and smile that should melt the very stones.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You matter-of-fact old Mildred,” I laughed.
“To think of your ever being so romantic!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She smiled a little as she unclasped her hands
from her knee and leaned back.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” she said, “I had my dreams once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then she continued:</p>

<p class='c005'>“He was older than I, twenty-five, perhaps; tall,
broad-shouldered, a manly man every inch of him;
a little clumsy and awkward at first, and lacking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>in all the manifold little attentions which girls like.
He did not offer to carry my bag, I observed, and
he entered the car-door first. He was certainly
not in the least like the courteous, gallant knight
of my girlish fancy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But presently, as he began to talk in an animated
way, his frank blue eyes lighted up and lent to his
by no means classic features a wonderful charm.
We got well acquainted on the short journey. He,
it seems, had, like myself, been at Concord only
once before. It was on that raw, cold day in ’75,
when I, a young school-girl, with my mother, and
he a Phillips Academy boy, had, unknown to each
other, essayed to board the train in that same
frightfully thronged station, and go to the Centennial
celebration.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I told him of my droll experience, wedged in
between a dozen men and women in the smoking-car.
He, it seems, was not so fortunate as I, for
he took no lunch, and, like thousands of others who
could buy nothing for either love or money, almost
starved. I told him about our experience: how we
marched with the women assembled at the town
hall, led by a lady with a little flag, around the
road to the tent on Battle lawn; how there we were
nearly annihilated by the throng, and how at last
by some good fortune I was borne up to the platform’s
very edge, and stood there within a few feet
of Grant and all his cabinet, and with Curtis, Emerson,
and Lowell all within arm’s reach.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How my heart beat at the sight of those faces!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>I have seen many famous sights since, but nothing
that ever stirred my blood like that,” said Mildred,
with glowing eyes. “I was scarcely more than a
child, Ruby, but I stood there for two mortal
hours, unable to move forward or backward, to right
or left, quivering from head to foot with enthusiasm
and excitement. That day my American patriotism
was born. I had studied a little text-book at
school, and learned names and dates; but not until
under the spell of Curtis’s eloquence, and face
to face with the men whose fathers had shed their
blood in the brave fight one hundred years before,
did I begin to realize what it all meant. I remember
particularly a little old man with weather-beaten
face, clad in a simple suit,—his ‘Sunday
best,’—who stood beside me listening with eager,
upturned face, his blue eyes filled with unshed
tears. I could see his lips quiver; and once, as
if carried away by the fervor of his emotion, he
grasped my arm with his brown, withered hand and
whispered huskily, ‘Little girl, when you get as
old as I be, you’ll understand what all this means.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“Since then,” said Mildred gravely, “the words
‘my country’ have meant something new to me.
A distinctly new idea took hold of me, an idea that
some time I hope to make blossom into deeds.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I confess I was getting a little impatient for an
account of the love-making, and this did not sound
much like it. But after musing a bit, Mildred continued:</p>

<p class='c005'>“This little experience which my companion and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>I had in common made us quickly acquainted. He
frankly told me of his college life and of himself.
He had been studying for the ministry, he said,
though whether he was to be a clergyman or not I
inferred was somewhat doubtful.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We passed Walden Pond, gleaming like silver
in the sunshine, and he talked of Thoreau, whom
he seemed to know well, though I had at that time
read nothing of him. Presently we rolled up to
the Concord station, and while a crowd of people
alighted and took the ‘barge,’ we went down one
of the long, shady streets, bordered by tall hedges
and close-clipped lawns, with comfortable, roomy
mansions set back from the street; past the little
gem of a town library, on its carpet of emerald
green; past the cluster of shops and the cool-plashing
fountain, and down the famous old road which
saw the redcoats’ flight, and which Hosea Biglow,
you remember, says he ‘most gin’ally calls “John
Bull’s Run.”’</p>

<p class='c005'>“Such a lovely, quiet old street! Dear, you
must see it some day—with the broad, green
meadow lands on one side, and the hill crowned
with trees and vines on the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Along this ridge lived Hawthorne’s Septimius
Felton,’ said my companion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘And here,’ said I, as we passed a tiny antique
house on the hillside with curtains drawn, and no
path through the grass that surrounded it,—‘here,
I am positive, an old witch with a black cat must
have lived a hundred years ago.’</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“We jested and laughed as we went merrily on.
We were young and happy that brilliant summer
morning. I remember how every leaf sparkled with
the heavy dewdrops, and the air seemed to fairly
intoxicate one like a draught of wine. I was fairly
brimming over with delight.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We passed the old-fashioned white house with
green blinds, peeping out from behind the pines,
which I needed no one to tell me had been the
home of the Concord seer; and a little further on
appeared the brown-gabled house, nestled in a
green hollow, and guarded by giant elms, where the
Little Women lived their charming life. Just
within these grounds stood the vine-covered Hillside
Chapel, whither our steps were tending. We
had passed little groups on our way, and now and
then we caught a word of what they were saying;
‘first entelechy,’ ‘pure subjectivity,’ the ‘<i><span lang="de">ding an
sich</span></i>,’ and so on, which in my hilarious mood served
as a further theme for jest.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As we took our seats beneath the bust of Pestalozzi
and beside the comfortable arm-chair always
reserved for Mrs. Emerson, I scanned the audience
closely. It was not a stylish one, and I felt a little
inclined to poke fun at some of the antiquated bonnets;
but my attention was attracted by the evident
eagerness with which my new friend was studying
the face of the speaker.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He was a middle-aged man, with close-clipped
gray beard and spectacles, and a face that seemed
to be the very personification of thought. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>subject of the lecture was Immortality. I listened,
vainly trying to understand, and feeling as though
the essence of a thousand books was being crowded
into that quiet morning’s talk. I had heard that
this man was a German rationalist, and was undermining
the foundations of Christianity; therefore
I had prepared myself to see a cynic or a scoffer.
I had thought that I would go, for once, to hear
what he had to say; just to have an idea as to what
it was all about. I felt all the excitement of doing
something a little venturesome.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear me,” laughed Mildred; “how droll it all
seems now, and what an ignorant little bigot I must
have been!</p>

<p class='c005'>“I tried to follow the speaker and to get some
meaning from those quiet, clear-cut sentences as
they dropped from his lips, and slowly forced upon
my incredulous mind the conviction that here at
least was one man who spoke whereof he knew. I
had never done so hard thinking in my life. He
was taking me into a field of thought of which I
had never dreamed, and I was as unable to follow
his giant strides as a child to follow the man in
seven-league boots. My temples began to throb;
in despair I gave up the attempt, and fell to watching
my companion as with bated breath he followed
the speaker. Only one thing I remember, and that
because I jotted it down on the back of an envelope
at the time. He said, ‘The standpoint of absolute
personality is the one to be attained. On this
plane, freedom, immortality, and God are the regulative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>principles of science as well as of life; and
they are not only matters of faith, but matters of
indubitable scientific certainty.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“The lecture was nearly two hours long, and
there was to be a discussion following it; but we
were both exhausted with the mental strain, and
quietly slipped out into the summer sunshine.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My companion said nothing. He walked with
head erect and long strides, and I felt considerably
piqued to find that he seemed utterly oblivious of
my presence. Presently he turned to me, and in a
tone which almost startled me exclaimed, ‘Thank
God for that man! More than any other man living
or dead has he kept me from making utter
shipwreck of my faith.’ I was surprised at his
earnestness and touched by the simple frankness
with which he had revealed to me, almost an utter
stranger, his inmost thoughts.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Again he seemed to forget me, and we paced
on in silence, past the fountain, under gigantic
elms, past the ‘town toothpick,’ as the æsthetic
scoffers have dubbed the obelisk that commemorates
the soldiers of the war, and turned down the
road by Hawthorne’s gray old manse and through
the avenue of pines, to where, stretching across the
sluggish stream, we saw the</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>... ‘bridge that arched the flood’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>where</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Once the embattled farmers stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fired the shot heard round the world.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Here we stopped to rest a while, under the
spreading boughs of a pine-tree, beside the graves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>of the two British soldiers that fell in the famous
fight. We shared our sandwiches and bananas, and
threw crumbs to the saucy squirrels that darted
from limb to limb above our heads; and then, like
two children, we trimmed our hats with daisies and
buttercups from the fields close by. I watched
him closely, with the pleasing consciousness that
my pretty dress and new hat were noticed with evident
approval on his part. Evidently he was able
to enjoy some other things as well as philosophy;
and when he shook back the thick blonde hair
which rose from his broad forehead in a sort of
Rubenstein mane, and tossed over into the fields a
great stone that had fallen from the wall, I began
to query whether a young man with locks and
sinews like a young Norse god might not be a
very fascinating type of hero.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I was curious to know what he meant by
‘shipwreck of his faith.’ As we picked up our various
belongings (this time I noted that he asked
for my bag) and walked over through the woods to
Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, I determined to probe
him a little.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Mr. Everett,’ I began, ‘don’t you think, after
all, that philosophy is a rather dangerous thing for
one to begin to study?’”</p>

<p class='c005'>I smiled mischievously as Mildred inadvertently
disclosed the name which hitherto she had adroitly
concealed. She flushed a little, as if annoyed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“After all,” she said, “you might as well know
his name, for he has gone, heaven knows where,
and I shall never see him again.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>A shade of sadness fell upon her face turned
toward the firelight, but she went quietly on:</p>

<p class='c005'>“He hesitated a moment before he answered, as
if mentally to adjust himself to my plane of ignorance.
Then he asked, ‘And why dangerous, Miss
Brewster?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘You know what I mean,’ said I, rather vexed
at being obliged to put my vague thoughts into
words. ‘What good can all this theorizing and
speculation do? Don’t you think it would be a
great deal better for all these people here to spend
their time in talking about something practical?
My feeling is, that people who begin to think and
question about God and immortality and such
things, and aren’t satisfied with the simple truths
of the Bible, get to be skeptics before they know
it, and are ruined for life. My mother’s religion is
good enough for me. If I can live up to that I
shall be satisfied, without racking my brains and
reasoning over things that God intended us to take
on faith.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“To tell the truth, this didn’t exactly represent
my thought; but I had often heard it said, and
thought it sounded well. Besides, I was curious to
see what he would reply to it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘It would take hours to answer adequately
what you have just said, Miss Brewster,’ replied
Mr. Everett; ‘but I will try to say something; for
it is precisely these same questions that I myself
have been trying to answer in the last few years.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“We were climbing the little hill that like a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>crescent surrounded the green hollow, where lie
the sleepers in their last sleep. On the summit,
beneath the tall sighing pines, beside Emerson’s
grave and within a stone’s throw of the graves of
Hawthorne and Thoreau, we sat down and looked
over the broad valley on the other side with the
hills beyond. It was so quiet, so peaceful, just
where a tired soul would love to have his last resting-place.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Everett was silent for a moment, as if to
collect his thought; then, not looking at me, but
afar off at the glimpses of blue between the swaying
boughs, he began to speak, while I listened intently,
every word fairly burning itself upon my
memory. I did not rest that night until I had
transmitted it all to my diary, to be read and reread
over and over again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘You say that your mother’s religion is good
enough for you,’ he began. ‘Well, Miss Brewster,
when I think of the love and devotion, of the tender
prayers and wise counsels that guided my boyish
waywardness, when I think of the saintliness
and unselfishness of my own sainted mother, I feel
like saying that, too. If I could ever have one half
her spirituality and Christlikeness, I should count
my life a grand success. But I cannot say, and I
know that truth and justice cannot compel me to
say, that my mother’s theology would be enough
for me, for her life was not the outcome of much
in her theology. Her unquestioning faith in a literal
Adam and Eve had nothing to do with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>sweetness and devotion to duty. Nor was her unwavering
belief in the sacredness of everything in
the sixty-six Hebrew and Christian books the cause
of her infinite patience and self-sacrifice. No; I
want my mother’s religion, but I cannot accept all
of her theology. I should count it a sin against
God if I were to so stultify my intelligence as to
do it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘You say, “Don’t you think all these people here
had better be doing something practical?” What
is more practical, I ask you, than for a human soul,
to whom life is something more than meat and
drink, to learn of that which more than all else
concerns that soul’s welfare? And what can more
help to this than the study of the wisest thought
of all the ages on just these very problems of life
and death, things present and things to come? As
Novalis says, “Philosophy can bake no bread; but
she can procure for us God, Freedom, and Immortality.”
I count that the most practical as well as
the most precious help that can be offered to any
questioning human soul who has come to see that
man cannot live by bread alone, and whose sorest
need is to know the meaning and the end of this
life of ours.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘But the Bible tells us that,’ I cried impatiently;
‘what more do we need?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Perhaps you need nothing more,’ he answered
quietly. ‘If so, well and good. Clear insight is
not essential to living a noble life. If you have
really grasped the spiritual meaning of Christianity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>it matters little that you should hold it in a more
naive and literal way than I am able to. If in this
age you can accept unquestioningly everything that
has been taught you, if you never have a doubt,
I would be the last person to raise one, for I know
what mental misery would ensue in one educated
as you have been. But so long as your religious
faiths have been inherited, like your hair and eyes,
and you have not examined them so as to make
them your own, pardon my saying that there is
small virtue in your holding them, and so far as
your own thought goes you might as well have
been a Papist or a Mohammedan.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘But what is the use of mental misery? Why
should I encourage doubts and unrest? Is it not
far better to trust in God and not venture to question
all the strange things that he allows?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘You ask two or three questions at once; let me
take them one at a time. Five years ago I asked
just those same questions, and I know how you feel.’
He spoke tenderly, and his voice comforted me. I
was beginning to get nervous and troubled and felt
myself in deep waters.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘No great thing is ever born into this world
except by suffering. If we are put here simply for
pleasure, for calm content, for peace of mind, let
us banish all questioning and dread it as a precursor
of the nightmare. Yes, if immediate peace of
mind is the primary consideration, let us, like the
ostrich, bury our heads in the sand, like the chicken
refuse to pick our way through the shell, and be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>turned out of our warm corner into the bare, cold
world outside. If peace of mind is our chief aim,
let us stop thinking once for all. It is dangerous.
Yes, thinking is always dangerous; dangerous to
one’s love of ease and content with existing ideas.
The little shoot content with its environment in
the dark mould will never reach the sunlight until
first it struggles upward from the conditions that
surround it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Many a time in the last four years I have said
to myself, in the night of horror that swept over
me, when I felt as if the foundations beneath me
had broken away, “whether the Bible be true, or
life eternal, or God a father, I do not know; but
this one thing I do know: I must be true; I must
be unselfish; I must go on and seek the light;”
and, thank God, I have begun to find it at last.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Everett spoke with a quiet intensity of feeling
that awed me. However, I ventured to ask,
rather timidly, ‘But you did find—you do believe
in the Bible now, don’t you?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘That is a question which cannot be rightly
answered by a “yes” or “no,”’ he replied; ‘for
neither answer would be true. I was brought up,
as perhaps you were, to look upon all these matters
without the slightest discrimination; to think a disbelief
in Jonah’s whale synonymous with the disbelief
in the divine inspiration of any part of the
Bible; to think a disbeliever in the Bible necessarily
a disbeliever in God; and to count a disbeliever
in immortality on a par with a bigamist or a horse-thief.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“‘When I dared trust myself to think and read
this book, or rather collection of books, with a
calm, unprejudiced eye, I was amazed to find how
much I had been taught to claim for them which
they never claim for themselves. They became
utterly new books to me, as if I had never read
them before; wonderfully rich and helpful and inspiring
and full, as I believe, of the truest religious
inspiration, but not always a guide for me in history
and science, and not infallible as to fact.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Who shall find any authority for the doctrine
that inspiration ceased with the last one of those
sixty-six books? No, Miss Brewster,’ said Mr. Everett,
looking at me earnestly, his shoulders thrown
back, his head erect, ‘God reveals himself to man
to-day just as truly in this new world as ever he did
thousands of years ago to Hebrew seers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘You ask why I should crave any deeper reasons
for my belief in God, free will, and immortality
than these writings give. Simply this: I must.
At first I fought against it, fearing it to be a temptation
of the devil. But I came to see that this
fear, for me at least, was cowardice and folly. The
command was laid upon my soul to give an adequate
reason for the faith that I held, and I could
not be recreant to this call of conscience. I had
been told to believe the Bible because it was God’s
Word, and then, following in a circle, to believe
that there was a God because God’s Word proved
it. It did not take me long to see the childishness
of this, and though I put it off again and again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>my conscience would not be stilled until I had systematically
set myself to see whether or not anything
could really be known, or whether inference,
conjecture, and hope were all that God had vouchsafed
to the creature made in his image.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘I suppose few women ever feel this necessity.
I do not say that it is necessary for you or for any
one to probe to the bottom of these things, if you
are content without doing so. I think, however,
that it is of the utmost importance for the thousand
bewildered spirits in our day, who long to know
but who cannot themselves study, to come to see
that knowledge on the questions which are most
vital to us all is to be had by every rational being
who has time and patience and follows the right
path of inquiry; and that in these matters, if we
are willing to pay the cost of time and labor, we
may in truth see and know.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘There are few who have the time or taste for
any deep philosophic study. There are fewer still
who have any faith in the outcome of such study,
and of these few but a handful who get started on
the right road and persist until they attain results.
Moreover, as truly in philosophy as in religion
must one be “born again”; and, unlike religious
birth, it cannot be instantaneous, for it is not a
matter of will. It takes years to bring about this
new and deeper insight.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘I rarely find a person whom I would advise to
study philosophy, for here, if anywhere, a little learning
is a dangerous thing, and one is maddened by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>the superficial talk of those who have not learned its
a-b-c, but yet presume to argue as if they had mastered
everything from Aristotle to Schelling. I
have come to find that there are very few people
who even dream of what philosophy is. The average
man fancies that speculative philosophy must
be simply guess-work or some vague theorizing, unworthy
of a Christian man who has any practical
work to do in this world in the way of earning his
living and helping to hasten the kingdom of God.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘But the average Christian is largely materialistic
in his thought. His heaven, his hell, are localities;
his God a huge, anthropomorphic being, and
the universe a kind of vast machine, guided by
some external Power; or a sort of precipitate or
sediment, as it were, of the eternal thought.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘If this is true of a man who professes and in
some measure accepts a real spiritual faith, how
much more true is it of the average worldly man
of common sense! He looks upon the ground he
walks on as something real. It is something that
appeals to his senses, and he smiles with calm contempt
if you tell him that an idea is far more real
than the earth beneath his foot; that it is thought,
and thought alone, that sustains this planet; and
that all the things that he considers real are in fact
mere passing phenomena, absolutely nothing in
themselves, except as they exist in relation to other
things.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I looked up somewhat perplexed at this and
was about to ask a question, but Mr. Everett was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>too preoccupied with his own thought to notice this.
Leaning his head against a gray tree-trunk, he
looked with absent eyes far off at the purple hills.
Presently he went on:</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Just as the sensualist can never understand
the spiritually-minded man and his infinitely higher
capacity for joy, so the man of mere <em>common</em> sense
can never understand the man of philosophic insight,
the man of more than common sense, until he
has been mentally born again, and has transcended
the materialistic phase of thought in which we all
begin to do our thinking, and which most of us
never pass beyond. As said the man whose dust
lies at our feet, “Every man’s words, who speaks
from that life, must sound vain to those who do not
dwell in the same thought on their own part.”’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘But is it necessary to go through this tragic
experience of which you have spoken in order to
reach right results?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Whether it be tragic or not depends upon the
temperament and traditions of the individual,’ he
answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘To me, brought up to know all that was possible
of the loveliness of Christian character, and
taught to attribute it to a theology that was more
or less false, a change of belief was naturally almost
as much to be dreaded as a deterioration in
moral character. From the cradle I was destined
for the missionary work; so you see that I had always
the fear of frustrating my parents’ most cherished
hopes if I should deviate from their standard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>of doctrine. In later years I gladly acquiesced
in their desire to see me in the ministry; it seemed
to me, it still seems to me, the most enviable life
in the world.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I listened eagerly,” said Mildred, “as Mr. Everett
said this. I, too, had often thought of the
missionary work, but I could not leave mother
then.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Well, Miss Brewster,’ Mr. Everett continued;
‘I was blessed or afflicted, whichever you may
please to call it, with a conscience which would not
let me rest content with tacit consent to what I
came to see was hardly more than a half truth,
and my inward life since my senior year at Yale
three years ago has been, until recently, one of
bitter conflict. Night after night, after leaving
the lecture-room at the seminary, have I walked
my floor until morning, too wretched to pray, my
brain half crazed with the ceaseless turmoil of my
thoughts. “I have no message to give to others,”
I said, “for I am sure of nothing; no one is sure
of anything.” Like the sad Hindu king, I asked
myself,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“How knowest thou aught of God,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of his favor or his wrath?</div>
      <div class='line'>Can the little fish tell what the eagle thinks,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Or map out the eagle’s path?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Can the finite the infinite seek?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Did the blind discover the stars?</div>
      <div class='line'>Is the thought that I think a thought,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Or a throb of the brain in its bars?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“‘But at last help came, I have told you through
whom, and now as I look back upon it, I thank
God for all that bitter experience. I know better
how to understand and sympathize with many a
one whom I have found struggling in the meshes
of sophistry; earnest souls, who long for the truth
more than they long for life itself, and finding no
one who can do more for them than to simply say
“Repent and believe.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Not that I have learned much yet. I have only
begun to get glimpses of the truth. I feel sure of
far less now than I did five years ago. But I know
this: I do know and see beyond peradventure that
it is right to probe to the uttermost the problems
which confront me. I should have been false to
myself, unfaithful to my highest, truest instinct, if
I had listened to the tearful advice of my timid
friends and turned my back and shut my eyes to
what God would reveal to me. I did not know
where I should be led; my knees knocked together
with fear as I felt my way through the gloom.
But gradually, and chiefly from the writings of that
man whose teachings we heard this morning, have
I learned not only to believe, but to know the
truths which he taught us to-day. Some men call
him skeptic, rationalist; at best they say, such
talk must be unpractical. Fools! not to know
that to save a soul from hopeless despair, to give
life and health to an immortal spirit, is quite as
practical a thing as to pave streets and cut coats.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘I look upon a true philosophy as the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>completely useful thing in the world.’ He stopped,
and I looked up bewildered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Useful?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Certainly; useful. Is not that useful which
gives man a clear insight into what must otherwise
be forever obscure? Is it not useful to lift him out
of the domain of prejudice and mere opinion on
vital matters, and give him the key to the universe
by making him to know the grounds of his knowledge,
of his being, and of his destiny?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘But do you not believe in relying on faith at
all? Do you accept nothing that you do not understand?’
I asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘I understand very few things that my reason
compels me to accept,’ answered Mr. Everett. ‘I do
not understand the chemical change which transmutes
my food into living animal matter, and I do
not understand a million things which I believe.
Certainly we must have faith. All business and
all life depends upon faith. But by faith I do
not mean the simple credulity of my childhood in
everything that I was taught. By faith I mean a
steadfast reliance on what my reason tells me is
true, even though I have no immediate evidence of
it, and imagination and understanding fail to compass
it. When I see the apparently useless suffering
and cruelty which the Supreme Power has permitted,
I have faith in his infinite goodness, not
because any man or book has told me that it is so,
but because, thank God, I see that it is so; and it
is philosophic study alone which has made me see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>this. He who is afraid to study and question into
the nature of the universe “and trust the Rock of
Ages to his chemic test” is the man who has no
true faith.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘But after all,’ I said, ‘you must admit that the
philosophers are but little read. It is the practical,
common-sense people of the world who have done
the work, and they have got on very well, too,
without all this theorizing.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘There was never a greater mistake in the
world,’ replied Mr. Everett vehemently, too deeply
in earnest to remember anything but the point that
he was trying to make. ‘The philosophers certainly
have not been widely read, but that by no means
measures their influence. It is they who have
taught the teachers who have taught the masses,
and as the traveler knows perhaps nothing of the
inventor of the engine which carries him safely
from one side of the continent to the other, and
makes life larger for him in a hundred ways, so we
all, reaping every day in every one of our human
institutions the rich benefits which the thinkers of
the ages have bestowed upon us, say ungratefully
that we owe them nothing. We attribute all our
speed to the visible engineer and conductor who by
another man’s genius have brought us to our destinations.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Would you advise me to study philosophy?’
I inquired humbly, much impressed with the point
of his reply to what I had flattered myself was a
rather bright remark.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>“‘That depends,’ he said, ‘on what and how you
study. If you wish to study simply to be able to
say or to feel that you have studied philosophy,
and can quote from this or that man, I advise you
not to study.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I must have flushed and looked a little hurt,
for he quickly added, ‘Pardon me, Miss Brewster,
I think that you are far too much in earnest for
that; but I have seen too many begin to read philosophy
as a mere amusement, a sort of fad, and
with no real earnest purpose, learning just enough
to make them conceited or discouraged, and doing
no good to themselves or any one else, and bringing
the study of philosophy into disrepute. To me my
philosophy has been a search for God, for truth.
I have studied for my soul’s sorest need, and in
all my intellectual life I have found nothing so
satisfying, nothing that gives me such hope and
courage.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Should you advise me to begin with Herbert
Spencer?’ I asked, thinking that I would come to
something definite.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘No, as you value your power to grow. You
are not ready for him yet. He would fascinate
you, and you could not refute his fallacies; but
read Plato, read Kant, Fichte, Hegel. Don’t begin
with them, though. Read first, perhaps, the “Introduction
to Philosophy” by the man whom we
heard this morning. I will give you also an article
of his which deals with Spencer in a way that
opened my eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“‘Don’t read much at a time, else it will utterly
daunt you. Come back to it again and again at
intervals. You will be astonished to see your
growth. You will be surprised to find how digging
at these tough problems makes such mental muscle
as renders other tasks easy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘It will open a new world to you; but you
must have infinite patience. I have made up my
mind to that. I shall be more than thankful if in
twenty years I have mastered this book;’ and he
drew a volume of Hegel from his pocket.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The sun was sinking behind the trees as we
rose to go homeward. Stiffened with sitting so
long, I tripped and fell. He sprang and caught
me in his great strong arms for one little moment;
then—well—I trembled a bit with the start it
had given me, and finding that my foot had really
been hurt a little, I accepted his help as we descended
the slope and climbed upon the other side
to the road again. It seemed very pleasant to have
his strong arm for a support. There had not been
a word of love, but his unaffected, frank talk had
touched me as no compliments or sentiment could
ever have done.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had thought his voice rather harsh at first
when he spoke so earnestly and vehemently, but it
had grown very tender and quiet now, and as we
came back from the woods to civilization again we
lapsed into silence.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As Mildred ceased, the clock struck midnight.
The noise outside had died away, and the fire had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>burned low, too low for me to distinguish her face
clearly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And was there no love-making at all?” I
asked, much disappointed at the prosaic ending of
the little romance that I had been anticipating. A
talk on philosophy in a graveyard was not the kind
of love-making that I knew about, and I wondered
if there ever were another girl like Mildred.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I didn’t say there was any love-making,”
said Mildred rather dryly. “I simply said that I
think I really was in love.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And is that all? Did you never see him
again?” I persisted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, several times afterward,” she answered;
“for I went regularly to the school after that. At
first I understood almost nothing, and much of
what he said was Greek to me. I met some delightful
people there, but he helped me more than
any one else. He loaned me books, and we had
many a talk.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I felt that we were becoming fast friends, when
suddenly he went West. I received a note from
him some months afterward, telling me that his
parents had died; but there was very little about
himself. I heard afterward that he was engaged;
but after Julia died I lost all knowledge of him.
Probably he has forgotten me long ago, but I owe
to that talk the best things that have come to me
since I was a woman. Yes, Ruby, that first April-day
and that second day in midsummer in old Concord
are the two red-letter days of my life.”</p>

    <div>(Extract from the New York “Tribune.”)</div>

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>BOOKS FOR THE MILLION! HELP FOR THOSE WHO WILL HELP THEMSELVES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It has been understood that Miss Mildred Brewster,
the Boston heiress and philanthropist who has
recently been making such a sensation in New
York society, was quite inaccessible to reporters.
But yesterday a member of the “Tribune” staff
was so fortunate as to gain a gracious reception, and
to learn certain facts which will be of great interest
to the public in general.</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Brewster was found in her pretty parlor at
the Fifth Avenue Hotel, dressed to attend a reception,
in an exquisite robe of golden-brown velvet,
simply made, and worn with a unique girdle and
collar of</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>RARELY BEAUTIFUL CAMEOS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Miss Brewster said that she was waiting for her
carriage, but was not in haste, and would be
pleased to make an authentic statement in regard
to certain facts of which there had been vague
rumors in the papers of late.</p>

<p class='c005'>She began by saying that she supposed the newspapers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>would learn it indirectly sooner or later, and
therefore she might as well give the facts so that
they should be stated accurately. What followed
will be given as nearly as possible in Miss Brewster’s
own words.</p>

<p class='c005'>“When I was a child,” she said, “I spent several
years in some of the frontier towns of our
Western states, where my father was vainly seeking
for a climate which would prolong his life. I
had an opportunity there to observe many things
which I have never forgotten. I understood them
but dimly then, but as I grew to womanhood in my
New England home, surrounded with the privileges
and traditions of an older and more distinctly
American civilization, I often contrasted my life
with what it would have been had I grown up among
the German farmers, rough cowboys, greedy land
speculators, and half-starved home missionaries, who
formed the chief part of the people whom we met
in the little towns along the railroad on the Western
prairies.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was too young to appreciate the value of the
indomitable energy of this pioneer work. I saw
only the sordid, unpicturesque side of it then.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hated the tornadoes and blizzards; I loathed
the sloughs and muddy streams—the everlasting
dullness of the prairie and the prosaic struggle for
existence in the little clusters of board shanties or
in the isolated log cabins and dug-outs. I longed
for the hills and granite bowlders, for the great
elms and sparkling streams of New England, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>for the refinements and conveniences of my Eastern
home.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How well I recall the tired, overworked women,
toiling over their cooking-stoves, with no household
conveniences, milking, churning, mending, washing,
feeding the pigs, selling eggs, and making
themselves prematurely old that their children
might have a ‘better chance.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I remember, with my insatiable love of reading,
how my first glance on entering a house was
in search of book-shelves. Many a time, though
in the house of a man owning hundreds of cattle
and a thousand acres of land, I have found no literature
beyond a copy of the Bible but little used,
the State Agricultural or Mining Reports, or a
stray copy of ‘Godey’s Lady’s Book.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, as an offset to this prosaic life, I remember
also, as I look back upon it now, the hopefulness
and cheerfulness, the ambition and self-sacrifice,
and the sturdy courage and self-reliance which
all this new Western life engendered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There was much that was admirable about it all,
and that gave promise of the development of great
men and women and a glorious future for that part
of our country. Yet I know that in many instances,
except where a colony of Eastern people had settled
and put up their schoolhouse and church before
there was an opportunity to build a gambling
den and saloon, the early influences which shaped
the future of the towns were like the sowing of
dragon’s teeth, which have brought forth, as I have
taken pains to learn, most deadly fruit.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“It is more than sixteen years since I have been
in the West, and I intend now to revisit it. Of
course I shall see an astonishing change. I read
of opera houses and electric lights in the places
that I remember as mere shabby settlements of a
hundred shanties. But the same condition of
things that I knew then is still to be found in a
thousand places further west, or off the line of the
main roads, and it will continue for a half century
to come. Hundreds of thousands of ignorant emigrants
are pouring into this land, with throngs of
alert young business men from the East, all making
a breakneck race for wealth. They are buying
the</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>LAST REMNANTS OF GOVERNMENT LAND,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>and are developing the material resources of the
country at an amazing rate. The shanties will give
place to brick blocks, and the sloughs to paved
streets, soon enough. I am not concerned as to
that.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The luxuries of civilization will come as rapidly
as one could wish, but it is the tendency of things
in regard to the development of morals and character
that alarms me. When I learn that one
third of our school population in this land of
boasted educational privileges is ignorant of the
alphabet, and that in the Rocky Mountain states
and territories there is one saloon for every forty-three
voters; when I read how the peasants of Europe
are flocking by the hundred thousand to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>fair Western land, and I see the possibilities of the
future for good or evil, it wakens all my ardor and
enthusiasm to be up and doing and lending a hand
to help shape its destiny.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are many who, not falling under good
influences at once, lapse into a selfish indifference
to everything but their own worldly advancement
if they do not retrograde morally. I do not mean
that they are heartless. They have, of course, the
proverbial Western generosity and frank cordiality,
which is one of the finest things in the world and
is very genuine; but it is often coupled with an absolute
contempt for everything beyond that which
will advance their purely material interests. In
short, they are ‘Philistines.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have seen many Western men who have
made their ‘pile,’ as they say, who would find it
absolutely impossible to believe in any one’s having
such a real, disinterested enthusiasm for art, or
science, or literature as would permit a man like
Agassiz to say:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>‘I HAVE NO TIME TO MAKE MONEY.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Do not misunderstand me. I would throw no
slurs on Western men. There are thousands in
New England as all-absorbed in money-getting as
they, only there is this saving difference: Here,
these men are, in spite of themselves, under the influence
of traditions and institutions founded by
better men than they; and there, they are the creators
of the traditions and institutions which are to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>be and which will of a surety be no better than
they choose to make them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is the early settlers that shape the future of
the country. Massachusetts, New Jersey, South
Carolina are to-day what their first settlers made
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe in the New England principles, and
in the men who sought New England’s shores, not
to find gold, to speculate in land, to buy bonanza
farms, but to found a commonwealth such as mankind
had never seen, a commonwealth whose corner-stones
should be righteousness and ideas.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is these New England principles that I
would engraft upon that great empire of the West,
which to-day is so plastic in our hands, whose
future we, to-day, have power to shape, but which
to-morrow we shall be powerless to mould.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I would teach them that all their limitless material
resources cannot make them the real power
in the land that little, sterile Massachusetts, with
her east winds and rocky soils, has been, unless
they first plant the seed that shall bring forth such
men of character and thought as New England has
borne.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why was it that so many of the men of this
century, whom the nation most delights to honor,
Emerson, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Lowell, Bryant,
Whittier, Holmes, Beecher, Curtis, Garrison, Phillips,
Webster, were sons of this New England soil?</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know that I am saying nothing new. All this
is very trite, as trite as the Ten Commandments.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>It has been said a thousand times; yet half our
people do not know it or believe it, and serenely
smile at what they call our ‘Eastern egotism.’ I
confess that we have quite too much of that. I, for
one, have almost as hearty a contempt as any of
them for the men who</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>... ‘sit the idle slaves of a legendary virtue</div>
      <div class='line'>Carved upon their fathers’ graves.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Let no one think that I am boasting of the New
England of to-day. I am simply saying that the
principles which have made her a power in this
nation are the principles by which, in East and
West, in North and South, this nation must rise,
or without which she must fall. And if the nation
is to be saved,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>THE WEST</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>must be saved. No man needs to be told that
<em>there</em> is to be the true seat of empire.</p>

<p class='c005'>“To me, this present war, waged between the
forces of good and evil, for the conquest of this
land, has an all-absorbing interest. Surely, as I
have said, this generation will not pass away before
the fate—that is to say, the influences which
are chiefly to control the destinies of millions yet
unborn—of this great nation will be settled.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As Miss Brewster uttered these words her cheeks
glowed, and her whole frame seemed to quiver with
the intensity of her feeling. She rose and restlessly
paced the floor as she continued:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have said all this because I want it understood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>why I intend to devote a large share of my
property to sowing all over the West and South
the seeds of what I count as best, in the form of</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>FREE READING-ROOMS AND CIRCULATING LIBRARIES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“I have been for some time carefully studying
into this subject, and I have learned some facts
which are rather startling when one considers the
inference which must be drawn from them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let me give you a few of these facts,” said
Miss Brewster, seating herself at her desk and
drawing some papers from a pigeon-hole.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Taking all the libraries which contain more
than one thousand volumes, and are absolutely free
to every one, I find that in Massachusetts there are
two hundred, and in other New England states—and
some of the Middle states as well—a number
approximating that. But what do I find in the
West and South? I find that Virginia, Kentucky,
Alabama, Arkansas, Montana, Arizona, Idaho,
Oregon, Nevada, Washington and Dakota territories,
and New Mexico, have</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NOT ONE FREE GENERAL LIBRARY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I find that Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Mississippi,
and Colorado have but one each; and that Louisiana
and Maryland have none outside of the one
largest city in each.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course what I have said does not imply that
there are no libraries in the states referred to. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>it does mean that there are but few, and that those
few are either subscription libraries or else belong
to schools or institutions, and are not open to the
general public.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How is this all to be explained? Is it sufficient
to say that the West is young and that the
South is poor and sparsely settled? The West
is young, indeed, but not too young to have magnificent
opera houses, hundreds of millionaires’ palaces,
and, in many of the new cities, richer clothes
for every one and more of them than the average
New Englander thinks he can afford.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The South is poor, very poor, and very sparsely
settled compared with the North. But the fact
that in those Southern states which I have mentioned
there is not one free library open to all,
such as one may find in scores of little villages in
the North, is not due entirely to poverty.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Even New York State, with her superior wealth
and population, and with an aggregate number of
all kinds of libraries nearly as great as that of
Massachusetts, has</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

<p class='c014'>which are absolutely free and general as compared
with the two hundred such in Massachusetts. And
Pennsylvania, with all her wealth and numbers,
shows no more than ten such libraries.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The farther one travels from New England,
the more surely does one find public sentiment indifferent
to these matters, and whole communities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>preferring to tax themselves for the adornment of
their cities, rather than to provide every poor man
with books. Books are considered a luxury, not a
necessity; to be indulged in only by those who can
afford to pay for them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>LEARNING FOR ALL</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>was the idea of the men who made the North what
it is. Learning for the few was the idea of the
men who made the South what it is. And the
men of this generation are reaping the harvest of
the seed which those men sowed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now I propose, as soon as practicable, to assist
in putting into several thousand little communities
in the West and South either a free reading-room
or a free circulating library, or both, thinking that
it will be the best possible use to which money can
be put.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps it may be wondered at that I do not
spend these millions in the direction of Home Missionary
work. I have several reasons for not doing
so, although I am heartily in sympathy with it.
Never was there nobler, more self-denying and
more fruitful labor than that of the overworked
men and women in the Home Missionary field.
But, in the first place, there are one hundred needed
where one can be found to go. The religious denomination
in which I was reared graduates but
about one hundred students from all its theological
seminaries every year, scarcely enough, one would
think, to supply the vacancies in the pulpits of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>East, to say nothing of the West, and I presume the
same is nearly true of other denominations which
I should be quite as ready to help as my own.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The library can never take the place of the
church, but I am convinced that in many communities
the provision of a comfortable, tastefully furnished
room, filled with periodicals, giving to every
one access to the best literary, political, scientific,
and religious thought of our time, will do quite as
much for the morals of a town as anything that
could be devised.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Unlike a church, it will be open every day in the
week. It will be a counter attraction to the street
and the saloon, and if there is a circulating library
as well as a reading-room, it will serve to stimulate
and open a larger life to every one who takes a
book from it. The home missionary shall not be
lacking, but she shall appear under the guise of a
librarian instead of a preacher.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In regions where there is a large proportion of
foreigners, there shall be books and periodicals in
their native tongues. Few who have not looked
into the matter realize the terrible mental strain to
the mind of the immigrant from the disruption of
old associations and the necessity, in middle life,
of adapting himself to utterly new conditions, in a
land where his language is unspoken. Many succumb
to this, and the statistics of the numbers of</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>OUR FOREIGN-BORN INSANE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>are startling.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“The same is true of the insanity caused among
herders’ and farmers’ wives by their dreary, isolated
lives on the treeless plains. We commonly
think of people living close to nature and absorbed
in simple daily tasks as being exceptionally healthy
and placid. But a visit to our hospitals for the insane
will tell a different story. The lonely woman,
with no outlook but the prairie’s level floor, to
whom a new book, a new picture, a new idea never
comes, is, as statistics show, as much in danger of
losing her mind as the man on Wall Street whose
life is a fever of excitement.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, to these tired, lonely women, to the young
girls who as soon as they are well into their teens
begin to think of marrying and abandoning all
study, to the young men so eager to make money
that self-culture is counted an unnecessary luxury,
to the boys who spend their evenings listening to
the vulgar talk of the teamsters at the corner grocery,
to the ministers and teachers who find that
their scant salaries permit of none of the new books
and papers which are essential to their mental life,—to
all these people I should like to give the blessing
of books.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The offer of a ‘St. Nicholas’ or ‘Youth’s Companion,’
from a pleasant librarian, will be quite as
effectual to keep a boy off the street of an evening
as an invitation from a home missionary to go to a
prayer-meeting. And to the man who may never
enter the building, the sight, as he passes to his work
every day, of a beautiful little temple devoted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>the things of thought, will serve all unconsciously
to make life seem a little cleaner and sweeter and
more dignified than it would be without it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now as to the details of this. In the first
place, I propose to help only those who are willing
to help themselves. That is my principle of work
in most matters.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is not a new scheme of mine. I have
thought of it for years, but it was until recently
only a dream of which there was no prospect of
realization. Now, however, I have taken steps,
which, whether I live or die, will scatter all over
the states and territories west of the Mississippi
and south of the Ohio little centres of learning,
which will reach far more people, and, I must again
repeat, do far more good than any other way possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have appointed two gentlemen, and they are
to select three other trustees, two of whom are to
be ladies, who will act with them conjointly in the
management of the fund. I shall leave them
largely to choose their own methods of work, but I
have made some stipulations in regard to the disposal
of the amount.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No sum whatever is to be given unconditionally.
Except for special reasons, no amount shall ever be
given for the establishment of a library or reading-room
which shall be less than fifty or more than
ten thousand dollars, and the amount given must
in every case be</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>DUPLICATED BY THE RECIPIENTS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“That is to say, if a little rural community of
five hundred people out in Nebraska is able to
raise one hundred dollars as a nucleus for a reading-room,
I will give an equal amount. Some room
over a store, perhaps, or in the church vestry, will
be rented. It will be fitted up with chairs, tables,
and lamps, which may be contributed by individuals
independently of the fund. Then the remainder
may be spent in periodicals and a few reference
books, to be selected by a committee appointed
by the town and by the agent whom I shall employ
to look after all details of the work.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have already engaged a dozen persons, New
England teachers chiefly, women whom I know,
whose good sense and executive ability are to be
trusted, and I have apportioned out the localities
in which they are to work. The first duty of each
one will be to put herself in communication with
the state superintendent of education, and to receive
his indorsement. Then she will make the
announcement in all the leading papers of the state
or territory, that she is the trustees’ accredited representative,
and is authorized to make such arrangements
as may be deemed fitting for the establishment
of free reading-rooms and libraries in every
township. Getting a list of such towns as have no
provision of this kind for books and reading, she
will proceed to communicate, either by letter or by
personal interviews, with the clergymen, mayors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>and leading men of the town, and, where any
apathy in the matter exists, will endeavor to arouse
interest and stimulate them to raise a fund.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wherever there is an interest and a desire to
take immediate advantage of my proposal by erecting
a building, the agent will join with the town in
deciding on the plan of construction, and in the
selection of a lot, insisting always that it shall be
ample enough to allow of the addition of more
rooms to the building as the town grows.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All the details of the arrangements will be submitted
to the head committee in New York, thereby
insuring the consideration of many matters essential
to the success of the scheme, which might be
overlooked by the average selectman, more skilled
in raising grain and killing hogs than in the science
of library construction.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course all this will require tact as well as
business-like habits on the part of the agent, but I
can rely on those I have engaged for these qualities,
and I will risk their success anywhere. I
shall urge them to encourage, wherever they can,
the erection of a small hall in connection with the
library building, which may serve for lectures and
meetings, and by pleasant, dignified surroundings
give a tone to the character of the proceedings held
in it, which might not be obtained elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall insist on making the buildings as fireproof
and as beautiful as the money will allow. I
want to make the Library the most attractive
place in town.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>“In farming communities, where houses are few
and far between, and an hour an evening at a
central reading-room would be an impossibility, I
shall suggest a circulation of periodicals after the
fashion of our Eastern book clubs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One great demand which will be made on us,
and which we are not yet ready to supply, is for
good librarians. I wish to call the attention of intelligent
young women to this field of work which
is about to be opened to them, provided that they
are fitted for it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In these new libraries, I propose to provide
the librarian at my own expense for the first two
years, thereby insuring the judicious management
and consequent popularity of the scheme.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A librarian who has the missionary spirit can
have, in a small town, about as christianizing an
influence as a home missionary. She will make
the library a pleasant place, where quietness and
good manners are the rule, and every one is made
to feel at home; she will offer wise suggestions as
to the selection of books, and give occasional talks
on authors and good literature.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean to send out strong, earnest, college-bred
young women, who will take a missionary
view of their work, and make it a means of great
good. I shall pay them well, and, as their terms
expire, shall transfer them from one place to another
to do pioneer work, varying their salary
according to the amount of work done.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My reason for choosing women for the work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>is, that I think them to be more faithful and conscientious
than men, as a rule, and to have more
tact and knowledge of detail. Besides, there are
more capable women than men who would be benefited
by the money and experience.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am especially interested in the success of my
scheme in the South, where a circulating library,
open to every one without distinction of race or
sex, is an almost if not quite an unheard-of thing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The scarcity of reading matter among both
colored and white teachers, to say nothing of other
people, is something fairly startling, and my agents
in the Southern states will probably be compelled
to adopt somewhat different measures from those
used in the West.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A circulation of magazines and papers will be
necessary in sparsely settled districts, where people
would otherwise have to walk two or three miles
to get any benefit from a reading-room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suppose, for instance, there is a little community
of fifty families, both black and white,
whose cabins and clearings are scattered over an
area five miles square. There are hundreds of
such places in the South where the people are
completely out of the world, and where not one
adult in five sees a weekly paper regularly or could
read it if he saw it. To these people, up on the
mountain sides, in the pine forests or on the river-bottoms,
my</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>BRAVE NEW ENGLAND TEACHER</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>will go. She will call them together and have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>meeting. She will get them to pledge, say fifty
dollars a year, and to this she will add another
fifty. Half of this, perhaps, will go for periodicals,
chiefly illustrated weeklies and magazines,
and the remainder will be paid to some of the
more enterprising who can read, and who will
agree to hold neighborhood meetings weekly. The
blacks will be with the blacks, and the whites with
the whites, probably, and the reading matter will
be read aloud for the benefit of all.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Some responsible committee will take charge
of the reception, distribution, and preservation of
the papers and magazines, and at the end of the
year they will, perhaps, be sold at auction among
the contributors to the fund.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If the reading matter were given outright
there would be some chance against the success of
the plan. People care little for what costs them
nothing. But having had to sacrifice something
to bring it about they will think it worth something.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What would you do, Miss Brewster,” the writer
inquired, “in towns where reading-rooms were open
to both whites and negroes? Have you any idea
that the whites would tolerate being brought into
contact with blacks on a par in a public reading-room?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Probably not,” replied Miss Brewster; “for
racial animosity is still pretty strong in most sections,
I imagine. But the difficulty could be</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>EASILY OBVIATED</div>

</div>

<p class='c005'>by allowing certain days or certain hours for one
race and other days or hours for the other race, so
that all could be benefited without setting prejudices
too much at defiance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At this juncture, Miss Brewster’s carriage being
announced, the extremely interesting interview
was terminated.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Buggsville, Mo.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Dear Friend</span>: The trustees told me that they
thought you would be glad to receive a letter from
me, telling you something about my experiences in
addition to the official report, a copy of which they
will forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>Buggsville, as you already know, is the first
town to put up a library building with aid from
the Western and Southern Library Fund. Therefore
I naturally feel considerable pride and interest
in this, the first-fruits of my labors, so far
as the erection of a building is concerned.</p>

<p class='c010'>I will say, by the way, however, that I have been
very successful in starting reading-rooms in the little
villages, sixty-eight little towns already having
them well equipped and beginning to produce a
marked result.</p>

<p class='c010'>Three months ago we started a reading-room at
Onetumka, ten miles from here. The people were
a rough, ignorant set, for the most part. A good
many foreigners are there, and a number of land
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>speculators and some mill hands, for they have a
good water-power, and are already beginning to do
a little manufacturing.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was really one of the most hopeless places I
have ever seen. The bad element had got the
upper hand from the first. There were five saloons,
and several low dance-halls and pool-rooms.
There was no resident minister, and they had
preaching only once in two weeks by an overworked
Baptist preacher with much goodwill and
little tact in managing so difficult a community.</p>

<p class='c010'>I always make it a point to get the ministers to
help me first of all, but here it was useless. So I
appealed to the school-teacher, the doctor, and the
mill-owner. The latter took little interest, although
I assured him that anything that could entice his
workmen from the saloon would make them serve
him better.</p>

<p class='c010'>The little school-mistress talked to her children
about it, but with no success; the doctor was indifferent,
and, as I had a more promising field elsewhere,
I stayed in the town only a few days.</p>

<p class='c010'>But presently the county papers began to be full
of the library business, and I was asked to speak
here and there in the little schoolhouses and
churches. At first I trembled at facing an audience
of one or two hundred, but I had not been a
schoolma’am for nothing, and I soon got over that,
at last finding myself no more afraid of them than
of my fifty boys and girls in the old school-room at
home.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>I found that this was the best way to arouse interest.
I gave them a practical talk, told them
about book clubs, Chatauqua circles and other
things, and suggested ways and means of raising
money. Most of them live pretty comfortably,
but money is scarce, and I find that most of the
farms are mortgaged. Generally, however, I found
some degree of enthusiasm, especially among the
women, when they learned that after the first
month it could be so arranged that the magazines
might be taken from the reading-room and circulated.</p>

<p class='c010'>You can’t imagine how many times I have heard
some tired farmer’s wife say, often with tears in
her eyes, “Miss Martyn, this’ll be a godsend to
me. I never get time to go anywhere, or to sit
down and read a book; but if I could have that ‘St.
Nicholas’ or ‘Wide Awake’ for the children, or
just sit down once in a while and read an article,
or simply look at those beautiful pictures in ‘Harper’s’
and ‘The Century,’ I feel as though I shouldn’t
get so discouraged with the work.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sometimes I feel as if I was forgetting all I
ever knew, and the children are growing up so
rough and don’t know about any other kind of
life,” they will say, in a troubled way, and I feel
sorry enough for them. In many cases these women
before coming west have had good educations,
and this monotonous life, in which there is so little
mental stimulus, is terribly hard for them to bear.</p>

<p class='c010'>Well, after a while, Onetumka heard what the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>other towns near by were doing, and one or two of
the mill hands wrote me that they had been around
collecting money and had secured fifty dollars,
beside gaining the free use of a suitable room.
So I went there and succeeded in raising the sum
to seventy-five dollars, to which I added as much
more. Then I managed to get the selection of the
periodicals myself, and excluded the “Police Gazette”
and some others that had been asked for.
As there is a large number of Germans here, I subscribed
for several German publications; also for
a generous list of illustrated papers of a harmless
sort, knowing that “Puck” and “Life” would be
better appreciated than the “Fortnightly” or the
“Contemporary.” Then I saw that a committee
was appointed to provide voluntary service in looking
after the room and circulating the magazines.
I arranged that the reading-room should be open
and some one in attendance on Sunday afternoon
and evening, as that is the time when the men
have a little leisure and the saloons do a great
business.</p>

<p class='c010'>In no place has there been so marked a result as
in Onetumka. A record is kept of the attendance,
and it has averaged seventy-five every day.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The reading-room is really a means of grace,”
the minister writes. I myself am aware of that,
and shall not fail to keep them stimulated until
they have a good library.</p>

<p class='c010'>I started a reading-room at Buggsville during
my first six weeks in the state. Here I found good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>ground for work. Most of the people were ambitious,
and some of the young ladies had formed a
Chatauqua circle, the only one that I have found
thus far.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were three little feeble churches, Methodist,
Presbyterian, and Baptist, each having about
half a congregation, and each unable by itself to
support a minister decently. They were willing to
make sacrifices for the library, however. I suggested
that while waiting for the new building they
should make use of the vestry of the Methodist
church. This is a large and well-lighted room, and
at a slight expense for shelves could accommodate
as many books as we could buy, and also serve
excellently for a reading-room. I found, however,
that this aroused a good deal of sectarian feeling
and would not do. The Presbyterians and Baptists
said that if their children should get accustomed
to going there during the week they would
want to go there on Sunday, and their own Sunday-schools
would dwindle. In order to leave their
vestry to be used solely as a reading-room, I suggested
that the Methodist Sunday-school should
meet at the Baptist church, holding its session at
an hour when the two Sunday-schools should not
conflict. But this, I discovered, was even worse
in the minds of these would-be Christians, who
were so afraid of each other, and I found that I
was sowing discord instead of harmony.</p>

<p class='c010'>At this juncture, fearing to lose all help from
me if they did not bestir themselves, one man gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>a lot 100 × 200 feet, on condition that a building
should be put up within a year; another who owned
a quarry offered stone for the building; the town
voted to give one thousand dollars, and the young
people, thus encouraged, set to work earnestly, and
by fairs and entertainments added considerably
more. I cheered them on with the inspiriting
assurance that every cent they earned meant two
for the library. The enthusiasm and good spirit,
when they got fairly at work, were marvelous, and
the people were drawn together in a way to make
them forget their differences in their zeal for the
common good.</p>

<p class='c010'>I found a good deal of strong opposition to having
the building open on Sunday. I had asked that
the reading-room might be open on Sunday afternoons
when there was no church service, knowing
that this would prevent a good deal of lounging on
street corners, and, moreover, subdue much disorder
among a set of restless street youth who are
fast becoming a terror to the town; but after a
great deal of discussion and hot blood over the
matter, the conservatives won the day.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yesterday the building was dedicated, and I was
requested to give one of the eight addresses on the
great occasion. The whole town turned out, and
it was a gala day. The stores were closed, and
after a grand procession, led by a German band
hired from a neighboring town for the celebration,
we proceeded to the library, which is really the
most beautiful building in Buggsville.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Every one felt a pride and personal interest in it,
from the two solid men of the town who had given
the land and the stone, and were consequently the
heroes of the day, down to the small boys and girls
who had all given their coppers. I felt that every
one in town was my friend, and as I rode in state
in the procession in a mud-bespattered buggy, the
boys cheered, the bells rang, and I think every one
felt that a new era had begun. The farmers’ boys
and their “best girls” came in from all the country
around, and I can’t describe to you all the droll
and pathetic sights I saw.</p>

<p class='c010'>I gave them a little talk on “Books and how to
use them,” as short and as sensible as I could make
it. At its close a white-haired old man, whom I
had never seen before, came and took me by the
hand, and said in a simple, childlike way: “Miss
Martyn, I want to ask you to tell that rich young
lady who has made this thing possible for us here
to-day that the blessing of an old man rests upon
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was born down in Maine, and never had
much schooling. I came to this part of the country
fifty-five years ago. My folks were killed by
the Indians. It was mighty different here fifty-five
years ago, I can tell you, Miss Martyn; there
were Indians all about then, and wolves too. We
had taken up government land, and after the old
folks were killed I kept on the place as long as I
could stand it, for the Indians had by that time
been driven off, and there was no more danger. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>was awful lonesome, though. There wasn’t a soul
within twelve miles to speak to. Sometimes I
thought I should go insane from lonesomeness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had only two books,—my mother’s little Testament,
and another book: perhaps you’ve heard
of it: ’twas ‘Locke on the Human Understanding.’
Well, I’d always been fond of books.
Somehow I never took to farming, and sometimes
I felt as if I’d give every acre I had for a new
book, or a newspaper that would tell me what was
going on in the world; something that would give
me new thoughts; I was so tired of thinking the
old ones over and over.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The fellows who were my nearest neighbors
weren’t my kind; they hadn’t any books, and, if
you’ll believe it, I’ve ridden many a time fifty
miles to get a newspaper a week old.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, at last I couldn’t stand it any longer.
I was ashamed to ask any woman to be my wife,
and to come out and live in my dreary log cabin,
even if I’d known any woman to ask, but I didn’t.
Unmarried women were scarce in those days. At
last I sold all the land for a song,—I should have
been rich now if I’d only kept it,—and I moved
a little nearer folks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I knew my Bible, and at last, though I hadn’t
much education, I began to go around preaching.
But a home missionary without a salary has not
much money or time for books; besides, before the
railroad, I couldn’t get books any way if I’d had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>money, and sometimes I—perhaps you won’t believe
it, ma’am, but I’ve actually cried for books,
I felt so sort of hungry and starved. I was thirty
years old before, to my knowledge, I ever saw a
book of poetry. It was Longfellow’s. Well,
ma’am, that book—I can’t tell you”—and the
old man’s blue eyes filled with tears and his voice
choked.</p>

<p class='c010'>His simple, genuine feeling was so sweet and so
unexpected that it fairly thrilled me. I think I
never realized in my life before what mental starvation
must be to a sensitive spirit. When I took
him by the hand and led him around to see all the
books nicely covered and numbered on the shelves,
he could only smile through his tears, and touching
them almost reverently, say, “Thank the Lord! I
never expected to live to see so many books. Thank
the Lord!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I inquired afterwards who he was, but no one
knew; they said he was a stranger who had come
there simply for the day. I am sorry to have lost
sight of him; he was a rare soul, I am sure.</p>

<p class='c010'>I did the best I could with the money that you
sent as a special gift for the first library. I sent to
Houghton, Mifflin &#38; Co., and bought their large
lithographs of the American poets, and had them
nicely framed in narrow oak frames, and hung
around the reading-room, with a little biographical
sketch pinned up underneath each one. The rest
of the money I spent for a number of unmounted
photographs from Soule’s, which I taught the young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>people here to mount and arrange in home-made
frames. No doubt, most of them would have been
much better pleased with some cheap chromos, but
I thought of what would please them best ten years
from now, and planned for that.</p>

<p class='c010'>They have already projected, at my suggestion, a
course of reading in the history of art; and whereas
a year ago it would have been impossible to get
most of the young people to undertake anything
really serious, they now evidently consider it quite
the thing. All this greatly encourages me, especially
as I see hopeful signs of the good fashion
spreading.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is a long letter, but I know your warm interest
in all the details of this work, so I make no
apology, and congratulate myself that you will consider
it a signal success to have one building all
equipped and in running order in eight months
from the time when you indorsed the scheme.</p>

<p class='c016'>GOOD CITIZENSHIP! HOW A BOSTON BEAUTY
PROPOSES TO BRING IT ABOUT! ANTIDOTE
FOR ANARCHISM!</p>

<p class='c010'>In the arrival in our city last week of the rich
Miss Brewster of Boston, society has naturally felt
a warm interest. First, because she is young and
charming; secondly, because she is reputed fabulously
wealthy; and thirdly, because she adds to
these attractions a decided mind of her own, which
has fortunately turned itself in the direction of alleviating
some of the woes of human-kind.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the pertinacious reticence maintained by
herself and the ladies and gentlemen who are her
traveling companions, and are understood to be
<i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i> for Alaska, has given our reporter more
than one fruitless trip to the Grand Pacific Hotel.
It is currently rumored that more than one</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div>EUROPEAN CORONET</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>has been laid at the feet of the bonny belle from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Beacon Hill, but, like the sensible little Puritan
maiden that she is, she prefers to keep the reins in
her own hands a little longer, and her millions will
not at present pass to any of the bloated aristocracy
of an effete despotism of the Old World.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was ascertained yesterday from the waiters
that the great parlors of the hotel had been engaged
by Miss Brewster for a large reception to
some of our most eminent citizens, chiefly in the
clerical walks of life. So a reporter in a ministerial
rig presented himself, was admitted, and taking
refuge in a camp-chair at the rear of perhaps two
hundred and fifty ladies and gentlemen, had a fair
opportunity to report proceedings.</p>

<p class='c010'>He soon discovered that the reception was nothing
more than a business meeting convened for the
purpose of listening to some address or discussion,
the guests being seated facing a slightly raised
platform.</p>

<p class='c010'>The assemblage seemed to be chiefly composed
of gentlemen, and every profession and sect was
represented by some of its most eminent members.</p>

<p class='c010'>At precisely eight o’clock Miss Brewster, conducted
by Rev. Dr. T——, entered at a side door.
They proceeded to the platform and took seats in
two velvet armchairs which were placed in readiness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Brewster was simply dressed in white, with
a corsage bouquet of yellow roses and a yellow rose
in her dark hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Dr. T—— rose to speak, the chatter ceased, and he said:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“<em>Ladies and Gentlemen</em>:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Each one of you present has received a note of
invitation requesting your presence here this evening
for the consideration of a plan which shall be
of benefit to our city. This plan, as it will be unfolded
to you</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div>BY ITS ORIGINATOR,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>will, I think, command your heartiest sympathy
and coöperation. I consider it a peculiar privilege
to present to you this evening one whose noble
father was my valued friend, and who in her earliest
years was well known to me; and now that she
returns to what was for a few months the home of
her childhood, it is with great pleasure that at her
request I have summoned here to-night so many
representatives of the thought and the moral force
of this great city to listen to what she has to propose,
and in return to give her the benefit of their
united wisdom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have the honor to present to you Miss Mildred
Brewster of Boston.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Every eye was fixed in admiration on the slender,
girlish form that had something queenly in its bearing,
and there was a rustle of expectancy as Dr.
T—— ceased and Miss Brewster rose to speak.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a slight tremor in her voice as with
deepening color and drooping eyes she uttered her
first words.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good friends,” she said, “I have asked you
here to-night for a specific purpose.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>“In the providence of God there has been
placed in my hands within the last few months the
means to do much that for years I have felt ought
to be done, but have been powerless to do. And
fearing lest my stewardship be short, and I be
called to give account and return with empty hands
and no fruit garnered, I have dared not delay, no,
not for a day, except to more seriously and wisely
prepare for my task.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Brewster gained courage as she proceeded,
and in a clear, unshaken voice continued:</p>

<p class='c005'>“In all lands on which the sun ever shone, probably
there was never a time when money wisely expended
could set in play so many and such powerful
forces for good as it can do now and here.
For here, in this western land of unlimited possibilities,
is the young giant born whose savage
strength may prove our nation’s weakness if we
leave his infant years to the guidance of his own
wayward will.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here, then, is the sorest present need in our
land to-day, for here in our hands lies the power to
mould the influences which shall shape the destiny
of millions yet unborn. One hundred dollars now
may prevent the evil which, a century hence, one
hundred thousand dollars could not undo.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As I have driven about your magnificent boulevards
and marked your towers and palaces, I have
been impressed even more than I expected to be,
and my expectations were great, with your wealth,
and its solid, satisfactory embodiment in enduring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>architecture and fine parks and streets. But not
only has your material advancement amazed me. I
have been most profoundly impressed with the seriousness
of mind and the depth of patriotic feeling
that was shown in your notable celebration of the
centennial of the beginning of our constitutional
government.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Historic old Boston, that of all other cities
should have appreciated the significance of the
occasion, gave hardly a thought to the day. New
York gave herself to ostentatious pageantry and a
glorification of Washington alone; but in this new
city of the West, unlinked by historic ties with the
past, have I found in press and people a deeper
sentiment and</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>A MORE THOUGHTFUL READING</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>of the lessons of the century.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have been studying this wonderful city of
yours that buys more of Browning’s poems than
any other city in the world, and is fast drawing to
itself not only the wealth and fashion of the land,
but that culture of which our older cities have fancied
themselves the almost exclusive possessors.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have been looking at your schools, your
churches, your philanthropies, and, above all, at
your poor, and that class from which your</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>ANARCHISTS AND CRIMINALS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>are recruited.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have found, as I need not say, much to admire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>and much to deplore. And it is to consider those
tendencies which I deplore that I ask your attention
this evening.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of all the dangers that threaten us as a nation,
I find but two unrepresented in this city, namely,
Mormonism, and the amalgamation of the white and
other races. But against intemperance, licentiousness,
political corruption, and all the evils incident
to a vast foreign population, this city, with its numbers
increasing by gigantic strides, presents a field
for work scarcely exampled on the continent. Not
that Chicago is a sinner above all other cities. In
some respects, notably its comparative freedom
from the close crowding in tenement houses which
exists in New York, it is fortunate.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, so far as I can learn, not another great
city on the continent contains so large a proportion
of people of</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>FOREIGN PARENTAGE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In driving through your beautiful avenues one can
scarcely credit the statement that only nine per
cent. of your people are of strictly native parentage;
but in going through that section on the North
side where your Poles and Bohemians live—in seeing
the Irish, Swedes, Germans, and more recently
the Italians, who are flocking to your city, one is
made to realize this in a measure. It is to this
point that I chiefly wish to call your attention.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This city is growing prodigiously; it is destined
to grow. More and more, as means of communication
and transportation are increased, as you well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>know, are the people of this age flocking to the
cities. One hundred years ago one in thirty lived
in a city; now one in four is the number which the
census gives us. Especially is it true that foreigners
prefer city life. In far greater numbers proportionately
to the native population do they congregate
in the centre of wealth, influence, and
political power, and often for the purpose of obtaining
that political power which through the
negligence and indifference of our better class of
men is readily yielded to their demands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now that the municipal government in our
great cities is largely in the hands of the foreign-born,
for which we have only ourselves to thank,
we are beginning to awaken to the fact, and the
indignant cry ‘America for Americans’ is heard.
With this I cannot wholly sympathize. We have
opened our doors to the world, we have invited to
our highest municipal offices whoever could buy
them, we have been eager to get rich, we have had
no time or interest in anything beyond satisfying
our imperious appetite for wealth and luxury and
social position.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We have put behind us simplicity and calmness,
the plain living and high thinking which engendered
all that we count best in our history, and
now we cry with ever-increasing wail, ‘Let us eat
our cake and have it.’ ‘Let us spend our whole
life in selfish indifference to the public weal; let us
turn over our most sacred trusts into the hands of
ignorance and incompetence, and then let us reap
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>what we have not sowed and garner where we have
not planted.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, not America for the Americans, if it be
such Americans! Rather let those who have been
willing slaves</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>FEEL THE WHIP AND THE SHACKLES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>until they learn that justice and peace and righteousness
within our borders are not to be, except
as the fruit of their love, their labor, and their eternal
vigilance. [Applause.]</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, not America for Americans, but America
for American ideas and institutions! And welcome
be he, whether of our own land or any other, who,
seeing what God has destined this fair land to be
as leader of the nations, seeing it as its early
Founders saw it, shall give heart and brain and
hand to purifying and redeeming it, lest indeed it
be the land of ‘Broken Promise.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have nothing to say against foreigners as foreigners,
but I look into our criminal reports and
find by a careful search that the proportion of
criminals to the foreign population is just about
twice that to the native. I learn that among our
foreigners we find about two thirds of our brewers,
distillers, and liquor-sellers, and among these
varied nationalities, who have sustained the breaking
up of old ties and transplanting to utterly new
conditions, a far greater tendency to insanity than
among the native stock. I see that the causes
which tend to immigration will in all probability
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>continue, and the influx into our great cities, especially
your own favorably situated one, advance indefinitely.
Therefore, it has seemed to me that of
all places in this land Chicago was the best one in
which to begin a concerted action for the Americanization
of its foreigners and for promoting the</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>GOOD CITIZENSHIP</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>of all its citizens whether native or foreign. It
seems to me we must do this in self-preservation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In Boston, as you know, where we have had to
learn some sad lessons from our careless indifference
in regard to municipal matters, we have begun
to arouse ourselves and have established a Society
for Promoting Good Citizenship whose object is
to further in all thinking people, mothers, voters,
teachers, and students, a higher ideal of citizenship
and an active, unpartisan effort for its realization.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This work is done in various ways: by free lectures
given by prominent citizens, by suggestions
for study in schools and colleges, and by the encouragement
of a deeper interest in the community in
the study of history, civil government, and political
economy. The society is yet in its infancy, and has
thus far produced little perceptible effect; but, in
addition to the well-known Old South work in history,
it shows a step in the right direction.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Long before it was started it had been</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>MY DREAM</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>to see something of a similar tendency established
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>in every large city in our land, and it is because I
wish to suggest to you certain measures which have
in view the attainment of good citizenship in your
midst that I am here to-night.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A Chicago gentleman recently said to me, ‘The
fact is, we get careless here. We are so busy about
our own private affairs that we let our voting go
by for a year or two, till finally about once in seven
years things get so bad we can’t stand it, and then
we all get mad and roll up our sleeves and go in
and have a general clearing out. After that, things
work well for a year or two, and then are as bad
as ever.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I understand that at present you have a fairly
good city government, that your leading officials
for the most part are not corrupt. But even if this
were sure of lasting, of what a thing to boast!</p>

<p class='c005'>“In the minds of too many I find the idea seems
to prevail that so long as taxation is not raised, and
there is a police force competent to quell turbulent
strikers, and no infamous scandal at the City Hall,
so long there is nothing else to be done in the line
of good citizenship than to cast one’s vote, pay one’s
taxes, and keep one’s sidewalk clean.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now I hold that such a conception of the duties
of citizenship is unworthy a Christian and a
patriot, and it is as Christians and patriots that I
am addressing you.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not here to remind you of the unequaled
folly and expense of bad government, and to point
out to you the material benefits accruing to a city
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>where there is a pure and economical city government
and an incorruptible court.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not here to speak to you on the ground
of mere utility and expediency, though with a different
audience such arguments might hold the
first place. But I speak to you as scholars, as men
and women of insight who need not to be reminded
that the state, as one of the three great human institutions
by which civilized man has differentiated
himself from the savage, has higher functions than
those which appeal most forcibly to the ordinary
man and woman of to-day.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We live in a</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>MATERIALISTIC ATMOSPHERE,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>where the things of the senses allure far more than
the things of thought, where a man of ideals is
laughed at by the majority as an unpractical theorist,
and shrewdness is esteemed the highest virtue.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have been looking over your school reports
and have been noting the disproportionate number
of girls who are graduated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your boys and young men are impatient for
business. Even those in well-to-do families leave
school very early. I find that <em>ninety-two per cent.
of your children leave school before they ever study
any text-book of history</em>, and that seventy-five per
cent. leave before they reach the grade where a little
historic information is given through the aid of
biographical sketches and stories.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Think of it! Seventy-five per cent., the majority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>of them our future voters, who have never so
much as heard of the Pilgrim Fathers or the war of
the Revolution, and who have far too feeble an educational
equipment to lead to much further study!</p>

<p class='c005'>“But even of those who have some smattering
of history we find thousands appearing at the polls
every year, having heard a little of the cant and
the bluster of partisan politics, and having nothing
more to fit them for their duties as citizens in a
land whose national and state and city governments
they have never studied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Moreover, they have the wildest notions in regard
to those great questions of labor, wages, and
reform which are agitating our country. Such are
the men who hold the ignoble conviction that every
man is selfish at heart, that to the victors belong
the spoils, and that desire for office is inevitably
ambition for personal gain.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have learned in the past somewhat of the
cost to this city and state of the presence of anarchists
within your midst. But what are you doing
to make good citizens of the thousands of men,
women, and children who are said to be enrolled
in anarchist Sunday-schools here in this city?</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is being done to prevent the children of
the mob that tears up your horse-car tracks when
you have a strike from following ten years hence
their fathers’ example?</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I am not speaking merely of rumsellers or
anarchists, or of ignorant foreigners or men who
sell their votes. I am speaking of the banker’s
sons as well as the blacksmith’s.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“There is among many of the hard-headed young
business men of our time whom I have met a</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>TERRIBLE SKEPTICISM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>They are skeptical of humanity, of virtue. There
is a belief that every man has his price, that politics
is a machine, to be run for the benefit of those
who have it in charge. There is, even among honorable
men, a tendency to joke at public scandals,
to sneer at Sunday-school politics and womanish
ideals.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, to me, this hard and cold skepticism betokens
a rottenness and a corruption in the body
politic scarcely less terrible to contemplate than
the open, high-handed peculation which occasionally
startles the community and forms a nine days’
wonder.</p>

<p class='c005'>“For, as I need not say, a sick man is as sure to
die from blood-poisoning as from an open cancer.
The latter may shock us more, but the former is
just as deadly. And the danger to this great city
to-day is not so much from the dynamite of the
anarchist as from the indifference and inactivity
of the men and women who have your brains, your
wealth, your culture, and many of them your nominal
Christianity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pardon me if I seem to be addressing you, my
elders and betters, as if I were presuming to tell
you anything new or anything which you could not
state quite as forcibly as I may do.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is not that I have anything new to say that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>venture to speak thus, but that I may clearly state
my own position and grounds for action in the
matter which I shall soon present to you.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have observed that I have used the more
comprehensive term ‘citizen’ instead of ‘voter,’
and it is for this reason that I have used it. The
duties of the citizen apply to every one who is a
recipient of the benefits of the state, and this includes
that half of the community whom their own
indifference and the</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>PREJUDICES AND TRADITIONS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>of the majority of voters still exclude from their
rightful share in this matter of public housekeeping
which we call municipal government.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is the duty of the male citizen to vote, and
not only to vote, but to attend the caucuses which
alone insure the possibility of having a worthy
candidate. It is also his duty to pay his taxes and
keep his sidewalk clean, but his duty does not end
here. It is his imperative duty as an honorable
citizen to see that this subtle poison, which, bred
from germs of selfishness and ignorance, is creeping
through the veins of our people, shall be arrested
ere a complete social upheaval teach us the
painful lesson that vigilance alone is the price of
liberty.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It seems to me that the duty of the citizen is
coextensive with life and opportunity. It is not a
duty which the man or woman of conscience can
lay aside between election days. The good citizen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>must be always a refuter of error, an initiator of
reform, in short, a person whose conscience gives
him no rest until what ought to be has been substituted
for what is.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The good citizen must, above all, have such a
lofty conception of the state and of statesmanship as
shall lift it forever above the moral plane where it
has been allowed to rest by the average conscience
dulled to all the finer moral perceptions by the
force of custom and conventionality.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are such citizens. I see many of them
before me as I speak, but that there shall be a
thousand where there is now but one, am I here to-night
to speak to you.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And now, after this lengthy prelude, permit me
to ask your attention to the scheme which I suggest
for helping to bring about in this city a higher
standard of good citizenship. Pardon a bit of personal
experience.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Scarcely a day goes by in which I am not importuned
by various worthy beggars to give thousands
and even millions to endow this and that college,
hospital, and asylum.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The last project which was proposed to me was
to put a million dollars into a college to be devoted
to fitting poor boys for the ministry free of expense.
And my importunate beggar was greatly
offended when I said that I should consider this
one of the best means for promoting hypocrisy and
dependence, and that I thought a few scholarships
wisely distributed in colleges of repute would help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>the ministry more than a million dollars expended
chiefly on brick and mortar.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘But what are you going to do with your money?
Don’t you think you ought to give it to the</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>LORD’S POOR?’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I was asked with that delightful assumption of
authority which certain people who have the assurance
of infallibly knowing the mind of the Lord
always adopt.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Certainly,’ I answered; ‘but the Lord has
commissioned me to spend what is intrusted to me
where it will effect the best results, and I prefer to
put the next money that I spend into brains rather
than into bricks.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now I propose to devote one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars during the next ten years to stimulating
thought in this city in the direction of Good
Citizenship. [Applause.]</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall ask a committee of twenty-five ladies
and gentlemen, which you shall choose from the
number present, to select for me a man of ripe experience,
of scholarship, and disinterested devotion
to the cause of which I have spoken—a man of
good presence and address, who can combine the
functions of business manager and orator, to whom
I shall pay five out of the fifteen thousand dollars
which I propose to devote yearly for the promotion
of good citizenship in your city.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By the advice and consent of this same committee,
which shall constitute itself a board of directors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>he shall spend the remaining ten thousand
for the best interests of the work in hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I put no restrictions on this expenditure and
lay down no rules of conduct beyond making the
work of the organization absolutely unpartisan and
unsectarian. The superintendent elected by the
directors shall be free to use such methods as shall
seem fit to him, being however held responsible to
the directors and removable at their option.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Although I leave everything to the judgment
of the directors, I wish to make a few suggestions
which they are quite free to accept or reject.</p>

<p class='c005'>“First I suggest that for this work the city be
divided into various districts, and that each church
constitute itself a centre for effective work in some
district, so that workers may be somewhat equally
distributed, and no part of the city neglected.
These districts need not be based necessarily upon
the numbers of their inhabitants, but upon their
needs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I would urge every minister either in or out
of the pulpit, as he may prefer, to make clear to
his congregation the purpose of this organization
which is to be formed, and himself lead his people
into hearty coöperation with it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know that there are some well-meaning,
religious people who might object to this, dreading
the preaching of politics from the pulpit and the
diversion of the attention of the young from strictly
religious work. They prefer to have everything
pertaining to secular education debarred from the
church-building.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>“To me such people seem</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SADLY IRRELIGIOUS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I wonder that they can read their Bibles and fail to
learn from the examples of the Hebrew prophets
what God would have man say concerning the
government and wise ordering of a backsliding
people. Those brave men of old were not afraid
of preaching politics; and how can one, the follower
of him who taught us to pray, ‘Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in
heaven,’ dare to make this but mere lip-service?
Surely they will be the first to give the influence
of their Christian manhood to bring that kingdom
here and now in this city of Chicago. The clergyman
who fails to teach his people that God as
truly leads this nation now as in the days of old
is recreant to his trust, is unworthy of his calling,
as it seems to me.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I would have our church vestries, which are
closed and vacant a great part of the week, thrown
open at least one evening in a week for discussions,
lectures, debates, or small classes grouped together
for the study of subjects that will promote good
citizenship.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I suggest that all classes of people, whether
church-goers or not, who are willing to join in this
work, be divided into four sections.</p>

<p class='c005'>“First and largest of all would be the section
containing those who know little of American history,
civil government, and political economy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>These would form themselves into bands for studying
a well-selected course of reading, beginning
with elementary work, and proceeding from such
books as Mr. Dole’s ‘The Citizen and the Neighbor,’
to profound works like Mulford’s ‘The Nation,’
or perhaps Hegel’s ‘Philosophy of History.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I see no reason why with a proper system and
the natural interest which I think the subject will
awaken there should not eventually result as widespread
and beneficent a work as that which the
Chatauqua classes have done.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There should be a secretary for each little centre
of study to whom reports of work should be
made, and certificates or diplomas should be bestowed
by the directors on those who have successfully
passed through different courses.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I also suggest public debates and dissertations
by members of both sexes. It is not so difficult a
matter as you may think to interest young people
in such work. I know of a teacher in Somerville,
Massachusetts, who for years has been the means
of carrying on a historical club of about seventy-five
boys and girls under fifteen years of age.
These children meet regularly, conducting their
meetings themselves according to Cushing’s ‘Manual
of Parliamentary Rules,’ and girls as well as
boys take part in a modest, fearless way. They
get not only much historical information on the
subjects they discuss, but also a very valuable discipline
which renders them self-possessed in manner,
and discriminating in their thought, and is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>the best of training for many duties of good citizenship.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All these results take time and patience and
tact in the planners of the classes, lest rivalry and
jealousy and short-sightedness defeat the end in
view. But when a</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SCHEME IS ONCE THOUGHT OUT</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>in its main features it is comparatively easy to
follow, especially when it is as flexible as the one
I present to you, and when the leaders are disinterested
men and women.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The second of the four classes which I have
suggested would contain a much smaller number of
persons, and would be those who have the time and
ability to teach. This would bring forth much
latent talent for home missionary work which does
not find vent in our mission Sunday-schools.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The work should be especially prosecuted
among the foreign population.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let a course of say twenty-five weekly lectures
be arranged to be illustrated by the stereopticon,
and treating in a simple way of the growth of our
nation from its beginning until the present time.
I would not have very much attention paid to the
campaigns of the wars. It matters little to the
Bohemian who cannot read English or to the Irishman
who cannot write his name whether Braddock
or King Philip fought in the war of 1812 or not.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But it does matter that he should understand
something of the early life of the colonists, something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>of the dangers from which they fled, the
causes of the Revolution, the growth of slavery,
the meaning of our republican institutions, our
great industrial development, and the significance
of such names as Franklin, Washington, Lincoln,
Grant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A cornet leading a chorus of school-children,
who should sing national airs, would add zest to
such a lecture, the price of which should be merely
nominal. I think you will generally find it better
to have a price.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In such matters people usually undervalue and
are a little suspicious of what is given them freely.
If a ticket costs ten cents, or if it is given as a
reward of merit to the children at school, it will be
vastly more appreciated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“These lectures would be given in English
wherever possible, but in the foreign districts of
the city the same set could be given in translations,
the speaker being an intelligent man of the
nationality of the audience.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think you will find it better among foreigners
to give these lectures in a hall rather than in a
church, so as not to awaken religious prejudices.
With different speakers the same lectures and
pictures can be used in different parts of the city
every evening in the week, thus having six or seven</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIMULTANEOUS COURSES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>of the same lectures.</p>

<p class='c005'>“After the completion of the first course much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>experience will have been gained in the details
of management, and other courses can be formed
illustrating the material resources, physical geography
of our country, and the biography and literature
of our great men.</p>

<p class='c005'>“With a little music, plenty of pictures, and a
speaker with a hearty, ringing voice, I think there
can be no question of winning attention among
these foreigners. After that, classes and clubs for
reading and discussion would easily follow.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have spoken of two sections, the students and
the teachers; the third might comprise those who
could give neither work nor study, but who would
give money. This money might go to any one of
a dozen fields of work which the organization
would help support.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Each donor could specify the purpose for
which he gives his money, whether it be temperance-reform
work, free kindergartens, industrial
schools, payment for detection and prosecution of
law-breakers, or general running expenses. You
can readily see that although there may be much
voluntary, unpaid service, there will be great
need of more money than I have promised to contribute.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The fourth class would be one of the most important,
comprising chiefly the solid business men
and practical, public-spirited women, such as I
have found here in your remarkably live Woman’s
Club and other organizations. These men and
women would attend to such practical work as is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>done by our Law and Order Leagues in the different
states, supplementing the often inefficient
police service, and persistently insisting that the
existing laws <em>shall be enforced</em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This branch of the work alone would require
more than one paid agent. Another line of work
for this fourth class of good citizens would be an
organized and ever-increasing vigilance in regard
to the work of the city’s servants, and the creation
of a strong public sentiment which shall demand a
purer, cleaner press and a suppression of the vile
literature which is poisoning the imagination of
thousands of our youth.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This class of workers would be the active agents
of all reforms, and unwavering in their efforts to
make the primary meetings places where the moral
force and the intelligence of the city shall be most
powerfully felt.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let me illustrate what I mean in speaking of
the kinds of work which this fourth class of workers
can do to promote good citizenship. The successful
courses of lectures on history to young
people under the auspices of the</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>COMMERCIAL CLUB</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>which have been carried on here is just the kind
of work which needs to be done. The prizes for
essays on historical subjects offered to the school-children
by the ‘Daily News’ is another good
thing. The courses of lectures by workmen and
capitalists under the auspices of the Ethical Culture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Society is just the kind of work which I
should like to see multiplied a hundredfold.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All existing organizations for promoting the
welfare of the community can unite in this large
organization without abandoning their own methods
and field of work.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps this scheme as I have outlined it may
seem to you somewhat utopian; but you will remember
that what I have said is simply suggestion.
The methods I leave entirely to your own excellent
judgment. But whatever these may be, they will
be watched with keen interest by other cities to
whom I shall make the same proposition that I
have made to you, provided that the results of your
efforts shall justify my action in this matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The little plan which I propose is</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>ABSOLUTELY FLEXIBLE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>One person or one circle may work in one way and
one in another, each according to his own tastes
and opportunities. While any one of leisure may
belong to all four sections, no one need feel excluded
from joining in the general good work in some way,
if he have but a dollar a year to contribute, or but
an hour a week for study or work.</p>

<p class='c005'>“May I not hope that the life and youth and
moral power of Chicago will join hand in hand in
making this vast city great, not only in dimensions
and numbers and wealth, but great in that kind of
greatness which alone shall exalt a nation and give
it memory. For</p>

<p class='c005'>As Miss Brewster stood a moment with silently
bowed head and then sank into her chair there was
a hush. Every one had been thrilled by the clear,
quiet, intense tones of her voice, and there was an
instinctive refrain from applause which marked the
deep feeling which her words had created.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dr. T—— rose to speak, but at this juncture
the writer, whose office had been discovered, was
politely requested by an usher to withdraw. It was
subsequently learned, however, that a committee
consisting of seven ladies and eighteen gentlemen
was elected from those present, and they are to meet
next week for selection of a superintendent, and to
establish their organization.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After leaving Chicago in June, we passed a
wonderful fortnight among the glories of the Yellowstone
Park. Here Mildred seemed to throw off
all care, and to breathe freely for the first time in
six months.</p>

<p class='c005'>After leaving the Park, some of our party were
called back to the East, but aunt, cousin Will, and
Alice still accompanied us.</p>

<p class='c005'>On touching the Northern Pacific Railroad
again our car was attached to a train filled for the
most part with immigrants.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the stations where stops were made we always
alighted to take a little exercise in walking
up and down the platform, and to chat with the
Indians and half-breeds, who greatly interested
Mildred.</p>

<p class='c005'>I must admit that for my part I found the
wrinkled old crones and dirty braves rather disgusting,
though occasionally a few who still retained
their primitive adornments of vermilion
paint and eagle’s feathers furnished a bit of picturesqueness
that was interesting.</p>

<p class='c005'>At one stopping-place, there being no Indians
visible, we turned our attention to the crowd of European
peasants who poured out of the immigrant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>cars, and strolling about among them we amused
ourselves by studying the stolid, square faces, and
giving candy to the sturdy, little flaxen-haired children
who gazed in round-eyed wonder at us.</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently I saw that Mildred, who had slipped
away from me, was holding a hurried and earnest
conversation with a sad-eyed little woman who
with quivering lips was telling the story of how
her <em>Mann</em> had died on the voyage and been buried
at sea, and how she was left to make the rest
of the long journey alone with her three helpless
little ones.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It goes to my heart,” said Mildred as we returned
to our car, “to think of that woman and
those poor, fatherless little things in this strange
land. Not one of the people with her is her friend
and neighbor, and I don’t know what is to become
of her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How perfectly dreadful!” exclaimed Alice
calmly as she scanned her cards.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gad, that’s tough!” ejaculated Will, and then
we proceeded with our whist, which had been interrupted
by this little episode.</p>

<p class='c005'>I watched Mildred. I knew that this would not
be the end of it with her, though the others soon
forgot about it. She played carelessly and was
beaten. She was thinking not of the game, but of
the tired, broken-hearted wife in the next car who
had so courageously said good-by to the Fatherland
a month before with her brave Fritz, and must now
end the long, wearisome journey alone, poor and
friendless.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Presently she rose and left the car.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let me go with you,” called Will, and followed
her, while I lay down on the sofa for a nap and
knew nothing more until an hour later. Then I
waked to find Mildred kneeling by my side and
smilingly patting my cheeks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you say to having an adventure,
Ruby?” she asked. “I have a capital scheme;
just listen to it. Will and I have been to see that
poor little woman, and it is pathetic to see how she
clings to us and looks to us for assistance. She
will be utterly helpless when she gets to the end
of her journey. Her passage is prepaid through,
but that is all. She has only three dollars left,
and the agent who has all these people in charge
is a hard-faced man who cannot be trusted to concern
himself in the least about her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She opened her whole heart to me while Will
amused the children, and I have learned all her
simple little story. I hadn’t the heart to leave
her until I had promised to see her through to her
journey’s end.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you forget, Mildred,” I cried astonished,
and sitting up quickly; “these people are all going
to switch off at the Junction and go twenty-five
miles on another road. The conductor told us so,
you know, and we can’t follow them, for it would
make us a day late in reaching Tacoma, and auntie
really must have her ulcerated tooth attended to.”
She had in fact hardly held her head up that day
and was suffering terribly.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>“Certainly,” said Mildred; “I have thought of
all that, and it is all arranged. Alice and Will
are to go on with her in this car and take the best
of care of her, and if you will join Hélène [the
maid] and me, we will go with the immigrants and
see little Frau Kopp well started in the new home
before we leave her. I consider it quite a fortunate
circumstance on the whole. I have wanted an excuse
to mingle with the people more and learn
something further of frontier life than can be seen
from the windows of a parlor-car.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Will remonstrated vigorously, however. “See
here, Mildred,” he said seriously, “it will never do
in the world for you to start off this way at night
into an unknown region, and ride in these wretched
cars. Very likely you will have to sleep on a straw
bed in some vile little tavern no one knows where.
You can give this woman some money, and”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I haven’t time to argue,” interposed Mildred,
packing her bag. “I have made up my mind to
go. Don’t think me stubborn, but money can’t do
for that disconsolate, frightened little woman what
I can do. She has not a single friend; her baby
is ill; some Yankee sharper would swindle her out
of her money; and, besides, I want to go. I want
to know from experience a little about the life of
these people.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then if I can’t dissuade you I must go with
you. Mother can”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, she can’t; and I can’t let you leave her,
cousin Will,” replied Mildred with quiet determination.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>“Nothing can possibly happen to us. We
are in a civilized land, and robbers are not wont to
attack an immigrant train. We shall not be hurt
by ‘roughing it’ for twenty-four hours, and if anything
happens to delay us longer we will telegraph
you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let me go <em>instead</em> of you,” insisted Will, still
frowning upon the project; “there is no need of
you three interrupting your journey when I can
manage the affair perfectly well.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you don’t speak German and I do,” replied
Mildred, decisively.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was nothing more to be said, and we bade
them good-by, with no misgiving on our part, and
stepped into the uncomfortable, stuffy immigrant
cars. Mildred seated herself beside little Frau
Kopp and held in her lap chubby two-year-old
Hans, dressed like a little old man in the clumsy,
German peasant fashion. Hélène and I meanwhile
took turns in occupying the only vacant seat in the
car. The motley crowd of Swedes, Norwegians,
Danes, Germans, and Bohemians, who for five or
six days and nights had been traveling together in
heat and discomfort, sat nodding sleepily and apparently
unexcited at the near approach of their
long journey’s end.</p>

<p class='c005'>All the afternoon it had looked lowering in the
west, and as the dim kerosene lamps were lighted
one by one, we heard the dash of rain upon the roof
of the car, and by the flashes of lightning could
discern with our faces pressed close to the panes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>that we were just entering upon the track of a
storm. Trees were uprooted and lay in confusion
beside the track. But we could see little, and I
gave scarcely a thought to it as I sat on the hard,
uncushioned seat, with my lap full of bags and
wraps, and watched Mildred a few seats in front
of me as she talked cheerily to the tired little
children. Our destination was to be the little
mining town of Blivens, and we were to reach it
at half-past eight.</p>

<p class='c005'>On we went whizzing through the darkness, the
train rocking from side to side, and the red-kerchiefed,
brown faces of the women lighting up picturesquely
the dark mysterious shadows. We were
about to reach our destination, and I had just risen
to rest my stiffened limbs, when suddenly I was
thrown headlong down the aisle, and a hideous
grating, jarring noise drowned every other sound.
Then a sense of falling, rolling, pitching, of absolute
darkness, and of frightful pain.</p>

<p class='c005'>I lay I know not how long. One foot and hand
were pinioned under something hard and immovable,
the other foot doubled under me, and my head
twisted awry and also immovable. I was lying
between two bodies, one above and one under me.
Something warm was dripping down over my face,
and shrieks and dying groans rent the air.</p>

<p class='c005'>I was too stunned at first to think what it meant.
I was conscious only of pain, horrible pain, such as
I had never dreamed of before. I could not cry
out, I could not move. Oh, would help never come?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>What was this horrible thing that had happened?
A moment ago—no, was it not an hour ago?—we
were alive and well; and now? Oh, why had God
let this horrible thing happen? And Mildred—where
was she? Perhaps she was dead; and I
should be dead too very soon, and nothing would
matter much.</p>

<p class='c005'>I remember thinking then, strangely enough, “I
am glad she has made her will.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly a dull glow, a gleam of light, then a
hoarse yell of despair from a score of voices, “Da
ist Feuer!” “<em>The train is on fire!</em>”</p>

<p class='c005'>My heart stopped beating. Were the horrors of
a holocaust to be added to this agony?</p>

<p class='c005'>Oh, the long, fearful minutes! A horrid glare
lit up the blackness of the night, and nearer, nearer
crept the crackling flames!</p>

<p class='c005'>O Christ! will no one come to rescue us, will
not the clouds in mercy pour down their treasures
to stop this demon flame!</p>

<p class='c005'>But no! The rain had ceased, and on, on, steadily
on came the frightful scorching flames.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was now as light as day. In the red glare I
could see black figures moving swiftly, men running
wildly about and desperately pulling and tearing
at the splintered sides of the car.</p>

<p class='c005'>But oh, how feeble all their efforts! How utterly
futile seemed all human strength to cope with these
frightful forces that held us relentlessly in their
grasp!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, it will soon be over, soon be over,” I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>groaned to myself. “The torture shall not be long
if with my free hand I can get a quicker death,”
I resolved in the desperation of my agony.</p>

<p class='c005'>It seemed hours to us wretches lying there ’twixt
hell and heaven, but I suppose it was only minutes.
Then there was a cracking, a breaking. An iron
crowbar in the hands of a man had broken through
the débris and was lifting the frightful weight
from my arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>I could see his face distinctly, as with the giant
strength of a madman, but with the clear eye of
one who was a born general, he marshaled his
panic-stricken followers and bade them aid him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here, Jim,” he shouted hoarsely, his voice rising
above the roar of the flames, “hold on there!
Now you and Tom and the rest, <em>pull!—pull as
you never pulled before</em>!”</p>

<p class='c005'>But it was all in vain; as well try to lift a mountain.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Take this child,” groaned a muffled voice at
my side, and as the strong arms of the stranger
lifted little Hans limp and lifeless, and hastily laid
him in the soft dark mud behind him, I saw for
the first time Mildred’s white face beside me.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There ain’t no use, boss,” cried the men in a
frenzy, and stopping to wring their hands. “We
can’t do nothing; <em>they’ve got to burn alive</em>!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then for God’s sake give me your pistol or
your knife!” I cried fiercely.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, Mildred,” I protested, “it’s right, it’s
right. If we must die, let it be quickly, and not by
inches.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>But Mildred did not hear. She was looking at
the stranger with wild, staring eyes, and for an instant,
as if paralyzed, he gazed at her. Then a look
of such agony as I never saw on a human face convulsed
his features, and he cried, “<em>Boys, once more!
I must save this woman!</em>” and while they stood
wringing helpless hands, he, with knotted veins
and starting eyes, made one herculean effort, and
Mildred was in his arms and free.</p>

<p class='c005'>I saw them stagger and fall together, while the
bright blood in a crimson torrent poured from his
lips and dyed her white, clinging hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then I knew nothing more. I have a vague
recollection of a roar as of Niagara filling my ears,
a sense of being torn limb from limb, a shuddering
thought that this indeed was death and the end had
come—and then blackness.</p>

<p class='c005'>I knew not how many hours or days had passed.
When I opened my eyes I was lying on a hard
straw bed on the floor of an unplastered attic room.
I could see nothing from where I lay but the corner
of a window through whose panes the sun
streamed in, scarce hindered by the torn blue paper
curtain. It shone upon the gorgeous patchwork
counterpane upon my bed. It dazzled my eyes,
which felt strangely weak.</p>

<p class='c005'>I tried to move, but could not stir; to speak, but
could utter no sound.</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently, as I lay with closed eyes, I felt that
some one had stooped from behind and looked at
me. Then I heard a husky whisper,—</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“She’s sleepin’ real nateral, don’t ye worry a
mite. <em>She</em>’s agoin’ ter git on, you can jest bet on
that.” This was followed by a heavy tread which
jarred my head with every movement like that of a
giant trying to walk on tiptoe. There was a creaking
of a door, then a slow, soft thump, thump,
thump down the uncarpeted stairs, and all was
still.</p>

<p class='c005'>I lay quiet, wondering what it all meant. Where
was I, and what could be the matter? My head
was confused. Was Mildred—hush, there was a
voice near by talking low; it seemed behind me.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But it was not so; how could you have thought
it so?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The voice sounded like Mildred’s. It was weak
and trembling.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I went East to find you after it was all over
between Agnes and me, but they said you were engaged,
you had gone abroad. I could do nothing.
I came back; I had my work, and I tried to live.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The other voice I did not know; it was husky
and broken.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was silence again, and I heard a bustling
and tramping about below, and outside the window
locusts buzzing shrilly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Voices again. I could not but hear. It was
Mildred’s voice. “But did you love me then in
the beginning?”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was no answer at first; then it came, a
little stronger and steadier than before. “I should
have loved you then if I had dared, but I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>pledged to Agnes; she had promised to be my wife.
There came a day at Concord when I saw my danger.
I knew that I must not dare to see you again.
I prayed that I might be kept from being false to
the woman whom I had asked to love me, so I went
away and tried to forget. After all, I had known
you for only a few days, and I had known her from
childhood. She was true as steel. She trusted
me; and when with her again I was glad to find at
last that life could still be rich and sweet, and I be
spared from baseness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then why, why”—Mildred began; but she
hesitated, and her voice died away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It came about in this way,” said the other voice
after a pause. “I had studied for the ministry, you
know. Agnes had rejoiced to think that she was
to share my work. I had decided from the first
to give myself to the home mission work either in
the far West or among the colored people at the
South. She was all enthusiasm and zeal. She
was a noble woman; but oh—well, it is a long
story, a long story.” Another pause; then, “Do
you know how unjust and bitter a woman can be
when she thinks that she alone is intrusted with
the decrees of the Almighty?</p>

<p class='c005'>“As her lover, I must be frank with her, I must
conceal nothing. I told her all, little by little, of
what I had come to believe and see. It only made
her tremble with horror. She saw that I was not
ready to preach the gospel which she believed. She
felt that I was going no-whither. ‘You have denied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>God’s Word and made your reason your God,’ she
said. ‘I can never dare trust my future with you
unless you promise me once and forever to abandon
reading these dreadful books which are leading
you farther and farther from the truth.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I tried argument, but it was of no avail. ‘I
am no logician; I cannot argue and reason with a
college-bred man like you. You could readily refute
my simple talk to your own satisfaction,’ she said;
‘but all the philosophy in the world cannot change
my faith. My husband’s God must be the one
whom I serve.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I did not know how I had really loved her
until I found I was breaking her heart. It was
pitiful. I tried to show her how I loved the same
God whom she served, but she said, while the tears
choked her voice:</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘No, Ralph, let us not deceive ourselves; we
look at the world in a radically different way.
There can be no compromises so long as this exists.’
So we parted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And then you—you came here?” queried
Mildred faintly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes. My life at first seemed wrecked; but I
had my work, and though I could not ask any
Missionary Board to send me out, I determined to
come alone and serve God, if not in the pulpit,
then perhaps as well some other way.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I came with the first miners. I lived with them
and worked for them. I helped them build their
first log huts. I opened the first store here, but as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>I sold no liquor it was hard to contend with the
other shops which soon were rivals of mine.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I made enough to live on. That was all
I cared for. I had come here to save men, not to
save money.</p>

<p class='c005'>“First I started a reading-room, here in my
room. It was open to them all, and after a while
we had an evening class. Then I began a Sunday
school, and they all came at first just to oblige me
because I asked them, but afterwards because they
liked it. Then at last I began a regular Sunday
service.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I love these rough fellows, and they have
learned to love me. I do what I can for them. I
would not change my work for the richest parish in
the country. I have the satisfaction of knowing
that I am helping to shape the future of this whole
region.</p>

<p class='c005'>“These men have loved me in a rough, hearty
way, and I thank God for it, for sometimes the
loneliness has been terrible.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Agnes married a missionary and went to India,
and after a while I saw that it was best so, though
it was bitter to me at first.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I felt that you, the only other woman for whom
I ever had cared, had forgotten me. I did not
dare to think that you had remembered me, but I
could not rest until I knew. I made the long journey
East. I felt that I could not be denied until I
had heard the final word from your lips. I reached
Boston the very day that you sailed from New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>York; and I heard that you were to marry a rich
man on your return.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I tried to bear it as best I could. I
came back to my work. After the little glimpse of
civilization and comfort that I had had, this dreary
little place seemed drearier still; but I had brought
books with me, and they helped me.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One day, as I sat here feeling lonely, wretched,
forlorn, I picked up my Thomas à Kempis, and suddenly
a light seemed to break in upon me, and I
said, ‘O fool, you with strength and vigor and opportunities,
you who have the inherited wisdom of
the world at your command, you the heir of all the
ages, the son of a King!—shall <em>you</em> mourn and
complain because Heaven denies you one boon?
When was it ever decreed that you should be so
favored above all other mortals as to be completely
happy in this world of pain? Should the servant
be above his Master?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“So then I tried to learn to be content. I found
something better than happiness,—it has been
blessedness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I study when I can. But I am studying humanity
chiefly. I am learning how to fill the needs
of these brothers of mine. I am trying to show
them that there is something better than the gold
which seems to them the only thing worth working
for. Yes, I love my work.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a note of exultation in the voice, weak
though it was, which thrilled me. I think I must
have dozed, for the voices again sounded faint and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>far away. Presently as I returned to consciousness
I heard the voice saying in little broken gasps of
pain, “But oh, Mildred darling, do you know
what this means? Do you know what it means
when you promise to be willing to take me for better
or for worse? You love books and pictures
and music and beauty. Can I consent to see you
deprived of them all, to share my lot?</p>

<p class='c005'>“You do not know me yet. You are grateful to
me for saving you; but it was simple humanity—humanity,
nothing more. I was a fool to speak out
as I did just now; it was only my weakness and
selfishness. No, I cannot let you bind yourself yet;
wait till you are well, till your friends come.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You say they have wealth. What will they
think of your giving them all up to settle in this
dismal place and be the wife of a man who has not
five hundred dollars in the world, and can offer
you nothing but a life of toil?</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, you shall be free. Forget that I dared to
speak, that I dared for a moment to think—What?
Why—why, Mildred, you are laughing!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh,” said Mildred in a different tone, “I—that
is, I was only thinking of <em>love in a cottage</em>. I am
not afraid of being poor; I can work too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, yes; but being poor in Boston, where you
have the largest public library in the world, and
the free Lowell lectures, and a glorious symphony
concert now and then for only fifty cents, is one
thing; and to be poor here, to stand at the washtub,
and to scrub and clean and bake and mend, is quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>another. There would be little call here for the
work which you love and can do so well. These
rough, hard-working men have little time or inclination
to hear of Goethe or Dante.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It would be cruel for me to let these soft, white
hands grow hard and rough, to let your life which
elsewhere could be so rich run to waste here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Would it not be far more cruel,” asked Mildred
tenderly, “to keep me from the man I love?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mildred dear, I am awake,” I tried to say, for
through my bewildered brain the meaning of all
this had begun to penetrate, and I realized for the
first time that I had been hearing what was too sacred
for any other ears than those of Mildred and
her lover, Ralph Everett.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the words choked in my throat, there was
only an inarticulate murmur, and the voices ceased.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Some time elapsed ere I divined where we were,
and then I discovered that we had been carried to
Mr. Everett’s house and were all lying in the attic
over the store. Mildred had been placed on his
cot-bed by the book-shelves, and he lay on a lounge
a few feet distant.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a time my straw bed, which had been borrowed
from a neighbor, was turned about so that I
could see them. I was too weak to talk, but I loved
to lie and look at them when the terrible pain gave
me a moment’s respite to think of anything beside
my own woes.</p>

<p class='c005'>The little town was crowded; not a spare room
but had been gladly given up to the sufferers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Little by little I learned all that had happened.
A tree had been uprooted in the wild storm and
had fallen across the track. The engine, the baggage
car, and the first car had been derailed. The
loss of life had not been great. Poor Hélène, the
little German woman and her baby were the only
ones who had not been rescued.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>But in all the cottages around lay the helpless,
wounded people, who had come so far over land
and sea only to meet this terrible fate.</p>

<p class='c005'>The telegraph lines had been thrown down in the
storm, and it was two days before word could be
sent and the débris cleared away so that trains
could come from the west. The little German doctor
who had set my bones while I was unconscious,
and had left medicine for us all, did not appear but
once or twice after the first call, for there were a
score or more of poor, maimed creatures, some of
them his own countrymen, who needed him even
more sorely than we.</p>

<p class='c005'>What would have become of us during those three
days of partial unconsciousness and suffering and
impatient waiting for our friends if it had not been
for “Jim”!</p>

<p class='c005'>Jim was a character. Not even the pain could
so wholly banish my sense of humor as to prevent
my seeing that.</p>

<p class='c005'>I could not learn whether there was a woman in
town or not, but I afterwards heard that Jim had
let it be understood that he was commissioned by
the “boss” to be his sole attendant, and warn every
one else to keep his distance. Half a dozen times
a day the big, freckled, red-haired fellow creaked
up the stairs in his stocking feet, bringing water
and gruel and bouquets of gorgeous nasturtiums
and crimson phlox from his little garden patch
across the way. Jim had an eye for the beautiful,
and thought it a pity that we should have nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>better to look upon than the long rows of sombre
books which lined one side of the walls and formed
Mr. Everett’s library.</p>

<p class='c005'>Accordingly the poor man had stripped his own
bachelor premises of all the precious adornments
sent him by his sweetheart for the last three
Christmases. There was a gilded sugar-scoop tied
with pink ribbons, and a remarkable landscape
painted on the concave surface of the interior.
There was also a rolling-pin with a covering of
French blue plush, adorned with gilded handles,
and bearing on its surface a large thermometer
surmounted by a gilded spread eagle.</p>

<p class='c005'>These were especially devoted to my benefit, for
which I was duly appreciative. Over Mildred’s
bed was hung a “God Bless Our Home,” wonderfully
worked in the national colors; and beside Mr.
Everett’s sofa was placed a gilded milking-stool of
convenient height for holding vials and glasses, the
legs artistically interlaced with scarlet ribbons, and
the seat decorated with a painting, whether of Vesuvius
in eruption or a dish of crushed tomatoes, I
was never quite sure.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the low window near which my bed was
drawn Jim proudly pointed out to me his own
quarters opposite. The house was an unpainted
wooden structure of one story, and evidently possessed
a slanting roof with gables, though the architect
had erected a sham façade which gave the
appearance, when one took a front view, of a house
with a flat roof.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Extending across the whole front of the house
was a sign of unique character painted in black on
a pink ground, of which I subjoin an exact copy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Jim is an odd stick,” Mr. Everett once said
with a feeble smile, as the awkward fellow was
heard anathematizing himself as he descended the
stairs after an accidental bang of the door, which
made us all wince.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Jim is odd, but he has mighty good stuff in
him. There isn’t anything that fellow would not
do for me, though when I first came here he was
pretty fiery; a regular dynamiter you would have
thought. But since I started the debating club,
and got him to reading history a little, he has
calmed down a good deal, and has come to find
that hard facts are worth more than all his former
rhetorical pyrotechnics about the down-trodden
workingman.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At last, with pale and terror-stricken faces, came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>aunt Madison and Will and Alice with Dr. Ellsworth
from Tacoma. Then ensued a new order of
things. Jim vanished, talking was forbidden, the
noise everywhere disappeared, and the clumsy carts
passed silently beneath our window over a thick
bed of straw, while tall screens, improvised from
sheets and clothes-horses, separated us from each
other the greater part of the time. For there was
not another room in town to be had, and the little
grocery below had been metamorphosed into sleeping
apartments for our four attendants. They alternately
watched and slept.</p>

<p class='c005'>The new physician threw away the old medicines,
substituted new ones, and looked with grave anxiety
on Mildred’s flushed face and bounding pulse. She
had no bones broken and but a slight wound, and
had insisted that my broken bones be set first.</p>

<p class='c005'>After the first shock, the excitement of meeting
Mr. Everett and anxiety for us all had sustained
her, but now she was sinking fast. The delay in
attending to her at the beginning was telling upon
her. Whether it was the July heat, the sight of so
many faces, and the necessary disturbance when so
many were forced to be in one room, I do not know,
but as the days went by none of us grew better.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mildred was too ill to be moved to her car. Mr.
Everett, though in a fair way to recover, was too
weak to stir after his terrible hemorrhage and the
strain upon his whole system; while I could not endure
to be touched without extreme pain. So during
the July days we lay there together in the unfinished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>attic room, watching the doctor come and
go, and tended by loving hands that divided their
ministrations and the delicacies that they brought
with the suffering ones who lay not far distant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do everything for them that I would have had
done,” were Mildred’s words to cousin Will, which
he understood as Mr. Everett did not. For no one
was allowed to tell him that this sweet girl lying
there, who I alone knew was his promised wife,
was no longer the teacher whom he thought her.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the doctor’s face looked graver and graver
as the days wore on. He sat up half the night with
us, performing the combined duties of nurse and
physician.</p>

<p class='c005'>One morning, as he came in looking weary and
jaded after but four hours’ rest, he sat down by
Mildred’s bed, with a face that in spite of his habitual
professional attempt at gayety could not conceal
the gravest concern.</p>

<p class='c005'>He felt her pulse and motioned furtively to aunt
Madison, who stood with brimming eyes studying
his every motion. Mildred glanced up and read
the meaning of his look. She said nothing for a
moment; then with an effort to keep her voice
steady she said, quietly, “Doctor, be honest with
me: shall I live?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear, I”—and the doctor coughed and
turned away his head; “I—we”—he glanced
at Mr. Everett, who with eyes that were blazing
like coals in their sockets had half risen on his
elbow and seemed devouring every word,—“my
dear, I hope so.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>“Yes, I understand,” replied Mildred calmly,
after a searching look at the physician’s half-averted
face, “I understand, and I am not afraid;
but it is necessary that some things be done, and
done quickly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She lay a few moments quietly thinking. No
one stirred or spoke, and the silence was broken
only by aunt Madison’s half-stifled sobs, as she
turned away to hide her emotion. Presently Mildred
looked up.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is there a lawyer in the village?” she asked.
“I want to change my—that is, I want to attend
to a few little matters of business that must not be
left undone.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” replied Mr. Everett huskily; “there was
one who did a little business, but he died a month
ago.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mildred said nothing for a few minutes, then
looking up, with a pale face and lips drawn tense,
she said, “Auntie, I must be married to-day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>We all gave an involuntary cry. Mr. Everett
drew his hand over his eyes. Dr. Ellsworth and
aunt Madison exchanged looks of amazement as if
to say, “Is the girl beside herself?” I alone understood
what it all meant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, auntie,” Mildred continued. “I have not
yet told you; I meant to, by and by. I did not
think it was to be here and now; I meant to have
it all so different; but my strength is going, I do
not know whether I shall—I dare not wait.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She gave a little gasp of pain, and was silent a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>moment; then she added, in a voice which I could
scarcely hear, “I have told Mr. Everett that I love
him. I have promised to be his wife.”</p>

<p class='c005'>No one spoke when Mildred had finished, and
she lay with closed eyes, while aunt Madison stood
as if struck dumb, gazing incredulously from one
to the other. She had learned that they were old
friends, that he had saved her life; perhaps she had
suspected more, but this sudden announcement paralyzed
her for a moment.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Everett half rose again from his couch and
leaned toward Mildred as if to speak, but the
words died on his lips, and he sank back exhausted
and lay motionless.</p>

<p class='c005'>Aunt Madison softly left the room, but soon returned,
and kneeling by Mildred’s side they whispered
together. What was said I never knew,
but I was certain that Mildred’s thought was for
Ralph’s inheritance.</p>

<p class='c005'>An hour later, another physician, who had been
telegraphed for the previous day, arrived. He
stepped softly into the room, and for a long time
gazed intently at Mildred as she lay asleep, and
then he slipped out, and I heard faint murmurings
of voices in the room below as the two physicians
held a consultation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Mildred, my more than sister,” I inwardly
groaned; “must I lie here helpless and see your
precious life going from us? Were you snatched
from the jaws of death but to fall back again a
helpless victim? If this must be, oh that we had
died together before rescue came!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>I had given my whole heart to this girl. I had
loved her with a love which made all other friendships
of my life seem as nothing. In loving her I
felt that I had first learned what love meant, and
my little, petty life had been made deeper, broader,
and full of hitherto undreamed-of possibilities.</p>

<p class='c005'>The hours wore away, the hours of Mildred’s
wedding-day. “Send Jim for Mr. Lightfoot,” Mr.
Everett had said to Will. “He will know where
to find him. He is the only regular clergyman
within fifty miles.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He had been sent for post-haste, and that evening,
just as the sun was sinking in the west and
lighting up in gorgeous splendor the little attic
where we lay, a tall, gray-haired man in a rusty,
black frock-coat, and with prayer-book in hand,
climbed softly up the creaking stairs and paused
in the doorway, glancing in a tender, fatherly way
at the two pale faces which looked up to greet his
coming.</p>

<p class='c005'>The windows were opened, and the blue paper
curtains had disappeared to be replaced by white
muslin ones. A dozen pitchers were placed around
the room containing the brilliant wild flowers of
the neighborhood that had been sent in by Jim and
his friends. A wreath of golden-rod and purple
asters at Jim’s desire was laid upon the white counterpane
at Mildred’s feet. For the news that there
was for some strange reason to be a marriage had
spread like wildfire, and many a rough, sunburned
man had tapped softly at the door of the little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>shop to ask what it meant, and beg Alice, who
stood on guard, to be allowed to come up and
stand, if only in the doorway, and see the “boss”
married.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day, a month later, Alice told me all about
it. “You don’t suppose, Miss, he’s agoin ter die?”
asked one of them, as they stood around the door
in a quiet, awe-struck group. “I don’t know what
we fellers ’ud ever do without him,” he added huskily,
as he drew the back of his grimy hand across
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t go much on religion,” said another, who
sat on the doorstep leaning his head in his hands;
“but I’ll be blamed ef that ere feller, with all his
college larnin’ and soft-spoken ways, a-comin’ out
here and roughin’ it with us, and a-nursin’ and a-teachin’
and a-helpin’ of us all,—I’ll be blamed if
that ain’t the Christianest thing I ever see.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I did not wonder that these men loved their
teacher.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ralph—I learned to call him that afterwards,
so I call him so now, for it seems more natural—Ralph
Everett had a face such as one sees only
once or twice in a lifetime. I did not wonder that
Mildred loved it so that she kept awake to look at
it as he slept.</p>

<p class='c005'>The forehead was broad and low, from which the
brown hair rose thick and abruptly, framing the
strong, almost rugged face. The eyes—such eyes!
They were the frankest, truest eyes that ever glorified
a human face. Not even Mildred’s eyes were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>like those, although hers could sparkle or command
or grow wonderfully soft and tender. The
chin and mouth were hidden in a luxuriant blond
beard, in which gleamed now and then a silver
thread. The broad chest, the sunburned face and
hands which the pallor of sickness was fast restoring
to their pristine whiteness, all evinced a strong,
active life, strangely contrasting with the pitiful
helplessness which had now prostrated it.</p>

<p class='c005'>But surely strength and health would soon return;
surely love would triumph; and these two, so
strangely reunited in the very jaws of death, would
some day make all previous joys as nothing to that
deep, full, complete satisfaction with which heaven
should crown their lives; these two, who seemed
of all the world the ones most worthy of such
blessedness.</p>

<p class='c005'>I had dreamed it all out. Some beautiful day
in the months to come I should stand as bride’s-maid
beside a happy, white-robed bride. There
would be flowers and music and smiles. There
would be the strong, gallant lover, the one man of
all the world who was worthy to wed my precious
Mildred. The man whom she would always know
had married her for herself alone, a man whom
wealth or happiness could not tempt, who should
nobly help her in the great work that she had set
herself to do.</p>

<p class='c005'>To tell the truth, I had thought also, with almost
a pang of jealousy, what this would mean to me,
and what my life would be without her.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>I could scarcely realize that now, here, in this
brown, unplastered attic room, in a dreary frontier
mining town, with no music but the chirping of the
August crickets in the little field behind us, without
wedding-robe or wedding guests, my Mildred
was to become a bride.</p>

<p class='c005'>They bolstered me up to see it all, as well as
could be done with my splintered leg and arm.
I was trembling violently, and the doctor gave me
a sedative powder and sat by me with hand on
my pulse. Ralph’s lounge had been moved beside
Mildred’s cot. His face was as deadly pale as her
own.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mildred,” he whispered hoarsely,—they had
not spoken to each other since in the morning when
she had said she would marry him,—“Mildred,
have you counted the cost? Think, darling, you
may get well; do you realize what you are doing?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, far better than you do,” she replied with
a faint smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>The clergyman quietly took his place at the foot
of the bed, and as the solemn words of the Episcopal
marriage service broke the silence, Mildred,
who had been lying with closed eyes, started visibly.
She had not before observed that the clergyman
had a prayer-book. I could see that she was greatly
agitated, and instantly divined the cause.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had always declared that she would never
under any conditions allow herself to be married
by that service.</p>

<p class='c005'>I knew her reasons for this and how strongly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>she felt about it, so I understood what her consternation
must be now. All this flashed through
my brain before the clergyman had read three
lines.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Mildred gave a little gasp. A crimson
flush leaped into her cheeks, and I knew her mind
was made up. Instantly her voice broke in,
strangely clear and strong.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please wait, sir,” she said. “I beg your pardon.
I did not know this service was to be used.
I cannot be married by it. Can you not substitute
some other?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Every one but Ralph was thunderstruck; but
they were getting inured to surprises, and no one
spoke while the clergyman, for a moment too
shocked to reply, gazed in blank amazement into
Mildred’s earnest eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Ralph understood, and said calmly, “No,
dear, he cannot. I should have thought of this
before. I am not willing that you should promise
what this service contains. So, in the presence
of God and of these witnesses, we two alone will
bind ourselves lawfully in the marriage bond.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, holding Mildred’s right hand in his, while
the minister stood wonderingly aside, he said with
clear, unshaken voice:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I take thee, Mildred, to be my lawful, wedded
wife, to love and to serve, to comfort and cherish,
to honor and keep, so long as we both shall live;
and thereto, God helping, I plight thee my troth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A deathly pallor had crept over Mildred’s face.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Just then the last rays of the setting sun for a
moment streamed into the little room, irradiating
its bare walls, and transfiguring with magic light
those two faces on which we were gazing with
breathless silence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, after a moment’s pause, Mildred with a
great effort leaned an inch nearer, and gently
taking Ralph’s brown hand in both her slender
white ones, said, with blanched lips:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I take thee, Ralph, to be my lawful, wedded
husband, to love and to serve, to comfort and
cherish, to honor and keep, so long as we both
shall live; and thereto, God helping, I plight thee
my troth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>After the last words had died tremblingly away
on Mildred’s lips, the clergyman at a sign from
her lifted his voice in prayer, while Alice kneeled
sobbing by the bedside, and over my eyes there
came a mist. My senses reeled, and I remember
no more.</p>

<p class='c005'>Weeks afterward Alice told me that Mr. Lightfoot
had gone away with a fatherly benediction,
and a purse the richer by a thousand dollars for
the marriage service which he did not perform.</p>

<p class='c005'>The days went by, and I knew but little. The
tall, white screen shut out everything from me. I
was too weak to ask about Mildred, but I knew
that she had not left us. Surely God had been
merciful. She was still to live and love and bless
the world.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last came a day,—it was the first day of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>September, I recall,—the very day when we had
planned to reach San Francisco on our return
from the Alaskan trip which we had contemplated;
the screen was removed, and Mildred and Ralph,
still pale and wan, but with the glow of returning
health lighting up their happy faces, sat beside me
and whispered words of farewell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Mildred, you did not die, you are alive,”
I sobbed weakly, too happy to keep the tears back.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, darling,” she said, “for it was love that
saved me. I had something to live for, and I
fought hard. Now I am to leave you for a while.
My husband and I” (how proudly she said that),
“my husband and I are going away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Her aunt Madison has kindly offered us her
beautiful, private car, and we are going away for a
long rest before we come back to our work,” said
Ralph innocently, and I saw that for some reason
Mildred had still kept him ignorant of the fact
that he had married a great heiress instead of a
poor teacher. “This is to be our honey-moon,
you know,” he added, looking at her with the
lovelight shining in his eyes. “We are going
quietly. No one but Jim is to know of it, for the
doctor says we must spare ourselves the excitement
of the good-byes which would have to be said if
the people knew we were going. The men have
been clamoring for a month to see me, and it has
been hard for me to keep quiet and not let them
come.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How would you feel,” asked his wife in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>careless tone, “if you had married a rich woman,
who would ask you to go away and never come
back to work here again?” and Mildred, who
was holding my hand, gave it a mischievous little
squeeze as she looked demurely out of the window
and awaited his reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know. I am afraid I could not quite
forgive her unless she gave me better work to do
elsewhere. I could not be idle, you know, even
with you, darling,” he answered, smiling at the
bright face beside him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, the world is large; there are many who
need us; rich or poor, we will find our work somewhere,”
said Mildred softly, as if to herself. Then
as Jim’s steps were heard at the door she started.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, Ralph, one last look at your books and
room, it may be long before we return. Kiss
Ruby, too; you must be her brother now, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Two warm kisses were on my cheek, then the
door opened and shut, and they were gone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Everything had been arranged for my comfort,
and a month later, when I was able to travel in a
private car which Mildred had sent us, aunt and
Alice, cousin Will and I, were on the Northern
Pacific Road again, bound eastward. And with us
went the motherless little Karl and Annchen to
find a new home and many friends.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day, as we were speeding along over the
Dakota prairies, Alice and I fell to talking as usual
about the summer that was past and its strange,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>strange ending. Suddenly Alice exclaimed, “But,
Ruby, I never thought to ask you before; <em>do</em> you
understand why Mildred, on her deathbed as we
supposed, should have stopped that minister? I
thought I understood most of her ideas, but <em>that</em>
was inexplicable to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I understand it, I suppose, for I once had
an argument with her about it,” I replied. “I remember
we had been to a stylish wedding at Trinity.
There were ten bridesmaids, and the bride was
dressed like a princess, and I remember how, as
we drove away, Mildred exclaimed that she would
rather have been married in a print dress in a log-cabin
and promise what was honorable and true,
than to have had the beautiful display which this
bride had, and make such promises as she had done.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘It is the most beautiful service in the world,’
I stoutly maintained; ‘pray what can you object to
in it?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘In the first place, the giving away of the bride
is a humiliating thing,’ she said: ‘it is a relic of
the feudal times, when a woman actually <em>was</em> given
away. It implies dependence; a woman is thus
simply passed along from the guardianship of one
man to that of another.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“This was a novel idea which impressed me
at first as being needlessly crotchety. ‘Then, of
course,’ I replied, ‘you object to the promise to
obey.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Certainly,’ said Mildred. ‘I should not respect
myself if I could make such a promise. Obedience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>implies authority, and a man and his wife
are equal. They do not stand in the relation of
master and servant, employer and employee, or
parent and child.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Yes; but it doesn’t mean anything,’ I expostulated,
‘it is simply a form.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘So much the worse,’ was her uncompromising
answer. ‘I will have no idle forms, no humiliating
promises which I should not intend to keep. If I
ever find the man whom I can marry, I think I
shall love him enough not to be selfish and willful,
and he will love me enough to respect me as his
equal. There can be no question of authority and
obedience in the true marriage.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Then, moreover,’ she said, ‘I object to the
man’s making the promise, “With all my worldly
goods I thee endow.” In nine cases out of ten
he does nothing of the sort, and the wife usually
asks for every dollar that she gets!’</p>

<p class='c005'>“So you perceive that after hearing her say this
I was not so much astounded as the rest of you
were,” I concluded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Alice, drawing a long breath and
looking meditatively at the diamond engagement-ring
on her white finger, “I never in my life saw
such an extraordinary girl as Mildred.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, I have vowed that I would never be married
but by that beautiful time-honored service.
Dear me! if we all took everything to heart as literally
as she does, what would become of society?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It would probably learn to speak truth and not
lies,” I answered.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the next few months I had many letters from
Mildred and Ralph, letters full of the warm interest
in life which came with returning health and were
an index of unceasing thought and activity in numberless
directions. Scarcely a state or territory
from Utah to Virginia was left unvisited and unbenefited
by their brief stay.</p>

<p class='c005'>Their course was not merely in the beaten track,
a superficial glimpse of the larger towns and fashionable
resorts, but far away from railroads and
civilization. On horseback tours in forest and
mountain regions they passed from cabin to cabin
among poor whites and blacks, studying the people
and their possibilities, the country and its
resources.</p>

<p class='c005'>The letters which Mildred sent me during these
months would fill half a volume, but I can find
space for only one extract from them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, my dear,” she once wrote, “I thought I
knew before how much there was that needed to be
done, but I am finding every day, after all, how little
I actually realized the true state of things. It is
not so much the physical discomfort that appeals
to my pity, as the apathy, the ignorance and lack
of ambition for anything better; the bitter religious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>and political prejudices that still linger, and
the spectacle of a population increasing in numbers
and increasing in illiteracy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course there are thousands of exceptions to
all these observations. I am not pessimistic.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The South is awaking, is advancing rapidly in
many ways, and, as I pass swiftly from place to
place and see new facts and phases of life, I am
constantly forced to reconsider and readjust my
previous convictions. Yet on the whole the main
impression which I had in the beginning survives.
Here is a vast territory practically not so well known
to us Northerners as most European countries, and
with a people who know us far less than we know
them; and here, as I am sometimes almost compelled
to believe, is the field for all my work and
energy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If I had twice my wealth, I believe I should
spend half of it in the South. I would engage a
few thousand of the best of our ‘surplus’ women
of New England and scatter them through the
length and breadth of this Southern land, and set
them at work doing some of the things which so
need to be done.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As it is, I have picked out certain strategic
places where I shall put a few at work, and for the
boy or girl who is willing to study and not afraid of
manual labor, I have made a good education possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is the most that can be done. Putting the
right persons in the right places is the best that I
can do, and then they must do the rest.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>“As you know, I have never felt inclined to put
my money into building new institutions, thinking
it best to work in other ways, or to help sustain
those institutions already established. But in these
last months my heart has gone out to the thousands
of neglected little colored children of the South
who are orphans, and who in many places have not
even a county poorhouse to shelter them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am thinking of establishing an orphanage
in every one of the Southern states similar to the
one at Chattanooga which I have recently visited.
I could talk to you for hours about that brave
Northern woman, Mrs. Steele, who has so nobly
been giving her life to this work.</p>

<p class='c005'>“At first persecuted, ostracized, and despised,
her building erected at her own cost burned by incendiaries,
she has gone unflinchingly on, until now
she has won the respect and has the aid of the best
society in Chattanooga.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She has rescued hundreds of poor little orphan
waifs from the chain-gang where they were put for
petty offenses, and from the street where they
roamed, with no bed but the sidewalk and gutter.
She has clothed them, fed them, taught them,
mothered them, and saved them. In all the South
I can hear of but one other colored orphanage, for
I find that the people for the most part are not yet
ready to tax themselves for the support of ‘little
nigger brats.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>I did not see Mildred until February. She had
telegraphed me to meet her in New York, saying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>in her message that she and Ralph were about to
go abroad for four years.</p>

<p class='c005'>By this time I had thrown away my crutch and
was myself again, and I hastened to meet her, as
she had appointed, at our old rooms at the Fifth
Avenue Hotel.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was out when I arrived, and I watched eagerly
from the window for her coming. Presently
I saw her,—how vividly I recall the picture,—her
hand on her husband’s arm, tripping along
briskly in the winter air, the roses in her cheeks,
her tall, slight figure clad in a trim suit of dark
green, her head surmounted by a soft toque of the
same color, trimmed with rich green holly-leaves
and red berries.</p>

<p class='c005'>How beautiful she was! More beautiful than
ever, I thought, as in glancing up she caught a
glimpse of me waiting, breathless, and threw me a
kiss with girlish glee. In a moment we were in
each other’s arms.</p>

<p class='c005'>How tall and stalwart Ralph looked as he seized
my hand in his strong grasp!</p>

<p class='c005'>I remembered that Mildred had once likened
him to a young Norse god, and I did not wonder.
As for Mildred, after the first greetings were over
and we had ensconced ourselves on a <i><span lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i> for
an evening’s talk, I soon perceived that a certain
indefinable change had come over her. I could
hardly tell what it was at first.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a vivacity and charm and sprightliness
that I had never seen before. I had always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>thought her charming, though perhaps a bit too
reserved and dignified. Some people had thought
her cold, but I knew better. Now all the latent
passion and warmth of her nature had been
aroused, and I saw that she had possibilities of
which I had not dreamed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it, Mildred?” I asked, after Ralph
had left us alone. “Somehow you seem—I
scarcely know what to say—you seem so young
and happy, as if”—</p>

<p class='c005'>Mildred finished, “as if I had been drinking of
the elixir of life and had become a new creature.
Yes, dear,” she added, “and so I have. Oh, I am
so happy, so unspeakably happy!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then suddenly turning impulsively and throwing
her arms around me, her face shining with a
new light, she exclaimed, “How I wish every one
else were as happy too.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sometimes it seems as if it were too much, as
if in this sorrowful world I had no right to be so
supremely happy. So often in these last months,”
she added musingly, “I have said to myself those
lines that seemed written for me alone:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘The face of all the world is changed, I think,</div>
      <div class='line'>Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul,&#160;...</div>
      <div class='line'>Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink</div>
      <div class='line'>Of obvious death, where I, who thought to sink,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was caught up into love and taught the whole</div>
      <div class='line'>Of life in a new rhythm....’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” continued Mildred after a little pause,
and her eyes grew soft and tender, “a year ago
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>I thought that love would never come, and I now
sometimes tremble at the thought of what I came
so near missing. I do not know how, once having
learned the blessedness of this love, I could have
courage to live if Ralph were taken and I left.
Oh,” she added in a broken whisper, as for a
moment she bowed her head in her hands, “if
when death comes it will only mercifully take us
both together.” Ah me! How little we both
dreamed in what way that prayer was to be answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently she raised her head and continued,
while her warm arms were about me again and
my head lay pillowed on her shoulder. “Ralph is
so kind, so good, so tender, so unselfish! Really,
at first he seemed almost sorry when I told him
my secret and he learned that he had married an
heiress, as if he had lost the joy of working for
me. How he thanked me for keeping the secret!</p>

<p class='c005'>“And oh, Ruby, the thought of what he is
makes me so ashamed of myself,” added Mildred
humbly. “I have come to see how far beyond
anything that I have done was his noble consecration
of all his time and culture and ability to
enrich the lives of those rough frontier men, while
I have done nothing but sit in a velvet chair and
sign cheques for money which I did not earn, and
could never spend on myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, after a pause: “Well, little sister,” she
continued, “you do not know, and I have no words
to tell you, of my happiness. I never dreamed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>what I was losing in all those years before love
came. I used to feel so strong and self-contained
and independent, and now, it is strange enough,
but I hardly know whether I have a mind of my
own or not. If I have, I cannot tell what it is
until I have asked Ralph;” and she laughed a
happy laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Mildred, to think that I should ever live
to hear you say that!” I exclaimed, laughing too.
“And do you still want to vote and decline
to obey? Is your haughty spirit quelled, and
have”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” said Mildred, ambiguously. “Ralph is
even more of a suffragist than I, and declares that
this nation has no right to call itself a republic so
long as one half of the people are disfranchised.
And he says the most splendid thing he ever saw a
woman do was my stopping that clergyman;” and
she laughed again a ringing, girlish laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a while we began to talk about Mildred’s
plans for the future.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I want you to know everything, dear,” she said
in her frank, confiding way. “We are going away
for four years, perhaps longer, for I want to study
many things, and I want to see Australia before I
return—that is a country with a future.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We must go now, though I leave so much
which is only begun and to which I wish to give
my constant personal attention. But the mental
strain this year has been great. I could not live
through another like it. We both want to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>far away from our responsibilities and possessions
for a while. I want to gain perspective, to have
time for quiet thought and study.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This was my plan from the first, as you know,
and now it is imperative. It is impossible for
Ralph to write his book with the cares and distractions
which we are constantly having.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“His book?” I asked; “I had not heard of
that. Pray what is it about?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is to treat of the colored races in our country.
He has been gathering the material for a
long time, and it will be an exhaustive work,” she
answered. Then she added, “I, too, have a little
book planned, but of a very different sort.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What! you, Mildred, an authoress!” I cried.
“Shall you really write a book?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, that is nothing nowadays, when authors
are as plenty as cooks and the world is flooded
with literary rubbish,” answered Mildred rather
disdainfully. “Any scribbler can write a book.
It takes neither wit nor wisdom for that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course; but you are not a scribbler, and
you won’t write rubbish,” I retorted: “But tell
me, what is it to be about? will it be a story?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” she answered. “The public does not
need any more stories, at least mediocre ones, and
mine could never be anything else. I trust that I
have too much self-respect left to be guilty of inflicting
another purposeless book on the world’s
already overstocked supply. Besides, you know,
Howells says all the stories have been told.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>“Then what is it?” I asked. “Is it sermons?
or sonnets? or”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” interposed Mildred; “it is <em>Suggestions</em>,—suggestions
to the idle and thoughtless, the rich
and the unconsciously selfish. I am confident that
there are some tens of thousands of people in this
country who are tolerably well-meaning, who have
a superfluity of leisure and wealth and strength
which they are letting run to waste because no one
has suggested to them what they might do.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Few people like to take the initiative. They
wait for some one to plan and organize and tell
them definitely what to do.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My first intention is to suggest to them that
they are peculiarly privileged mortals, and that
life is worth living only on the condition that one
does something with it. That they are sinners
above all other sinners since civilization began, if
they let themselves be ignorant of what they should
know and indifferent to the evil which they should
help; the more their culture and ability the greater
their debt.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean to suggest some very practical things
which might be done, which need to be done.
There will be suggestions for those who have time
and no money, suggestions for those who have
much money and no time, suggestions for people
who think they have neither time nor money, and
suggestions for developing influence and talent
where there seems very little to start with.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not that these will all be particularly new or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>original. That is not necessary. We heedless mortals
need to have a wise thing said many times
and in many ways before it makes much impression.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall not attempt to suggest many new principles
of work, but simply to make many new applications
of the old ones.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Ruby,” exclaimed Mildred, her mobile
features glowing with the enthusiasm of the thought,
“what a metamorphosis of this planet we little
mortals might make if we all did, and did wisely,
what it is quite in our power to do!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Such a book is a capital idea,” I exclaimed,
much impressed with her plan, “and it will have
double weight because you have already provided
the most effective object lessons as illustrations of
what might be done.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is not exactly what I mean,” replied
Mildred, shaking her head. “No; few persons
have it in their power to work in the way that I
have done on a large scale. I am not sure after
all that this is what is most needed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Model tenement houses and libraries are not
going to save people from selfishness. There must
be the tireless, personal, face-to-face and hand-to-hand
work of men and women who have come to
know themselves as their brothers’ keepers. Institutions
and paid agents can never do this work.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But they can help enormously towards it,”
I replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly,” said Mildred; “they will organize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>and start the work; but then it is all these people
for whom I shall write my suggestions who must
do the rest of the work, and they alone can make
it effective.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, for instance, here is a plan which Ralph
and I have just been working out. It is to help
save the half-grown boys and girls who night after
night find their chief delight in strolling arm in
arm through the streets, with smoking, and vulgar
jests and silly laughter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know well enough what the social dangers
are to underpaid, giddy-headed girls shut up all
day in shop or factory and longing for freedom and
companionship.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Night after night have Ralph and I walked up
and down watching them, listening to their silly
giggles and cheap talk, noting their tawdry jewelry
and ribbons and frowzy bangs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How I pity them! I should so like to make
life a little better worth living for them. Who
can blame them for not wanting, after a hard day’s
work, to stay in their crowded, noisy homes or
dreary boarding-house hall-bedrooms?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Everywhere that we have been we have made
it a practice to visit the dime museums and cheap
theatres, and to study the amusements which these
young people crave! Everywhere I find it the
same.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I used to know in a vague way about this
night-side of things, but not until recently have I
realized the awful temptations which are besetting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>these empty-headed girls who have no resources in
themselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Free lectures, or concerts, or libraries have
small charm for such as they. They want to exercise,
to flirt, above all to talk and laugh to their
heart’s content.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The churches do not meet more than one in a
hundred of such girls and not more than one in a
thousand of such young men. They have no desire
to spend an evening at a prayer-meeting, they
would feel out of place at a church sociable, and
they are too tired and unambitious to care for any
classes or study.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They want a good time; they want ‘fun,’ and
they have no idea that it can be found among
members of their own sex alone. And in this
their instinct is half right.</p>

<p class='c005'>“These young people ought to exercise and have
‘fun,’ and they ought to have it together.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are various coffee-rooms for temperate
men, and various girls’ club-rooms for girls alone,
but, so far as I know, scarcely a respectable place
in the whole city where an honest, self-respecting,
poor girl can go and be able to meet honorable
young men, under the protection of those who
would see that her natural instincts were gratified
without sacrifice of her womanhood.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is just such a place as this that we have decided
to establish, a social club for young men and
women, where they may laugh and talk to their
heart’s content and have plenty of innocent fun.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>“And fall in love with each other?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly,” was the reply. “Why not? Does
not all experience show it to be impossible to purify
society by breaking natural instincts or ignoring
them? Oh, my dear,” continued Mildred earnestly,
“the pure love of man and woman should be the
most blessed thing in life, and I who know the joy
of this love would gladly keep these brothers and
sisters of mine from letting it be trodden in the
mire, or on the other hand slip forever out of their
lives.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But how can this be done?” I questioned
skeptically. “By simply substituting for the sidewalk
a room in which to giggle and flirt?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Listen,” said Mildred. “We shall not begin
by building until the experiment is assured, but we
have already hired ten places in different parts
of the city, where, with the help of the ‘King’s
Daughters’ and the young people of the Society for
Christian Endeavor, we shall begin this work.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The first thing we did was to engage a kind-hearted,
middle-aged married woman to be the responsible
head of each social club. She is to see
that pleasant pictures are hung upon the walls, that
potted plants are put into the windows, and everything
made homelike and cosy and in good taste.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are to be no printed rules and mottoes
hung around the wall, as if it were an institution
and we were trying to do the people good. They
would be suspicious of anything of that sort.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>“How many rooms have you in each place?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, that varies,” answered Mildred. “In
most of them there is a small hall with waxed floor
and piano to be used for dancing or singing classes
or debating clubs. There is another room for gymnastics,
with apparatus and a piano, where a competent
person will direct, and gradually insinuate
various sensible ideas in regard to high heels, tightlacing
and a bad carriage, and try to make physical
culture seem a desirable thing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There will be another room for quiet games
like checkers and dominoes, several bath-rooms,
and a parlor where the girls can bring their fancy
work and receive their friends.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Mildred,” I cried in alarm, “you will
get a perfect mob, if you are not careful. They
will bang your piano to pieces, they will have rude
kissing games, the girls will waltz with men whom
they never saw before; and then, if you make rules
and don’t let them have their own way, they won’t
come. I know the kind of people whom you want
to help, and they are the most independent creatures
living.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, but wait a minute,” replied Mildred calmly.
“The ‘mob’ are not to be invited to pour in from
the street. Each one must apply for a membership
ticket, give name and address, and wait a few
days before it is granted. There may be, perhaps,
a slight nominal fee. They will appreciate it
more to have this little formality about it. Moreover,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>the lady who is at the head of the club, and
who will be a person of character and tact, will
have authority to exclude any unruly member.
Nothing will be said about rules. They will be
received as if they were of course expected to behave
well.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Five or six of the ‘King’s Daughters’ have
agreed to be in attendance every night, with as
many gentlemen who are their escorts. They will
play for dancing and gymnastics whenever it is
needed. They will act as daughters of a host and
receive and introduce their guests. They will join
in the singing and the games and the conversation,
and, with the gentlemen whom they bring, will, I
think, be far more effectual in encouraging good
manners than any number of rules.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now that everything has been planned and
the wherewithal provided, I have had no difficulty
in getting some hundreds of agreeable, well-bred
young ladies from the different churches who have
each pledged themselves to bring some gentleman
to assist them and to give one evening a week
faithfully to the social club.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is distinctly understood that there is to be
no authority exercised by them, no patronizing
tolerated, and charity, and that other odious word
philanthropy, not so much as thought of.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All are to meet on the same footing, simply as
young people who are met to have a good time in
an orderly, pleasant way.</p>

<p class='c005'>“At first there will doubtless be hoidenish manners,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>a good deal of simpering and whispering and
flat talk, which of course must be ignored. But
by and by the presence of ten refined, Christian
young gentlemen and ladies with tact and quick
wit will make itself felt. There will be charades
and word games like twenty questions, and a hundred
such merry ways of passing the time, of which
these girls have never dreamed. They will go
home with new ideas about dress and manners and
ways of having a good time. The veriest boor,
who may begin by tipping back in his chair and
picking his teeth, will not fail to observe finally
that if he wishes to retain the respect of his ‘best
girl’ his manners must conform a little more to
those of that young law student who spent half an
hour the other night showing her how to play parchesi,
and then helped her on with her waterproof,
put up her umbrella for her, and bowed her a
pleasant good evening.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I assure you,” continued Mildred, “I have made
the discovery that the best way to turn a silly little
chit into a self-respecting woman is for a gentleman
to treat her as if she were one. And the
best way to make a stupid clown appear at his best
is for a young lady of tact to try to draw him out.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But this is not all. There are endless things
that such a club might do.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hope it will develop all sorts of latent talent
and mutual helpfulness, and lead the way to discussion,
comparison, and emulation in a thousand
ways.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>“It will give each member an opportunity to
make fifty acquaintances where now he or she has
but one,—Protestants and Catholics, Jews and
Gentiles, mechanics, factory operatives, shop-girls,
bookkeepers, young professional men, teachers,
millionaires’ daughters, all meeting on the simple
ground of their youth and American citizenship,
and giving each other the pleasure of their company,
the benefit of their experience. And the rich
will find that they get even more than they give.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, after all,” I urged, “can you make oil
and water mix? Is this a feasible scheme?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is to say,” answered Mildred, “can people
of different social rank, education, and employments
meet socially with mutual profit and pleasure?
That, I am convinced, depends entirely upon
the tact and spirit of genuine friendliness which
is exercised by those of the higher rank.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Anything that is done perfunctorily is sure
to fail, but genuine interest will create genuine interest.
It all depends, you see, upon my helpers.
Without them my money can do nothing. I can
only organize; they must execute. But I am convinced
that it is an experiment worth trying.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So you are contemplating a social revolution,”
said I, as Mildred paused, her cheeks glowing
with the excitement of the thought. “Well, sister
mine, if ever one is brought about, I think it will
be by your way of doing, by trying to put the
right people in the right place. After all, I suppose
this one little scheme of yours and Ralph’s,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>that may help to start thousands of lives in a different
direction, probably costs no more to permanently
endow than what some families would
pay for diamonds and horses and yachts for themselves
alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the way, Ruby,” asked Mildred the next
day, as we sat sipping our after-dinner coffee,
while Ralph had gone out to see some lawyers,
“do you remember the first time I saw you, a little
more than a year ago, at aunt Madison’s?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Remember? I wonder if I shall ever forget
it, or what you said to those three rich good-for-nothing”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” broke in Mildred, “not ‘good-for-nothing,’
though I fear I thought them so at the time.
I fancy I must have spoken pretty savagely, didn’t
I?” Then, without waiting for an answer, she
continued: “I felt sure, as I thought it over afterwards,
that they would hate me, that is, if they
took the trouble to think about me at all. But,
do you know, I think it really startled them into
asking themselves some pretty plain questions.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It set them to thinking, and” —she continued
with a laugh— “I verily believe that I was in a
measure the humble means of grace which brought
two of them to conviction of sin and led to their
conversion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let me read to you part of a letter which
cousin Will received and which he forwarded to
me,” said she, drawing an envelope from her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>pocket. “It is from Ned Conro, the one with the
blond mustache, you remember.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He says,—let me see,”—and she glanced
down the first page, and, turning the leaf, read
aloud:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I began for the first time to do a little thinking
that last six months at Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Somehow that cousin of yours had said something,
that night I was at your house, which kept
running through my head and bothered me every
now and then. I began to wonder if I weren’t
about as useless a lot as a fellow with two millions
in his own right and a prospective Harvard sheepskin
ever gets to be.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had shirked all the work that I dared to.
I divided my time, as you know, pretty evenly between
the Boston Theatre and Young’s Hotel. I
had no incentive to work, and did not propose to
follow in your steps and study a profession. I
planned after I left college to go abroad for some
years. I had some vague notion of a trip to India
and tiger-hunting. At all events I meant to have
good sport and plenty of it too.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The last thing I thought of was giving up any
fun to stay at home and play the home missionary.
But every time I had settled the matter
completely in my own mind, those stinging words
of that girl would come back and make my ears
tingle:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Oh, the last thing that you ever dream of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>is that you have a debt to pay and are basely
repudiating it.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had thought that all poppycock when she
said it, but when she got her money and set to
work practicing what she had preached, giving not
only her money but her whole time with her
money, that just stumped me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One day I took up a New York paper giving
an account of her great library scheme. ‘There,’
said I, ‘Miss Brewster has done what no man I
ever heard of would have thought of doing.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“A man, now, would have put up a stunning
ten-million-dollar library, with his name in gilt
letters on the front of it. He would put half of
the money into the building and half of the remainder
into rare books which no one would look
at once a year. It would be a grand thing, no
doubt, but how many people would it reach compared
with those whom Miss Brewster’s little libraries
will stimulate and help?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, a library can change the future of a
whole community! I tell you, Miss Brewster has
found where to sow her seed so that it will bring
forth a hundredfold.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wondered what <em>I</em> could do. I could throw
away my money easily enough, endow another chair
at Harvard, erect another statue to some one, build
a hospital; but, after all, what was <em>I</em> to do, provided
that I did anything?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, one day—it was Thursday afternoon—Mather
said, ‘Conro, let’s go into chapel and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>hear Brooks.’ So we went. I hadn’t been inside
the place for months. My set, you know, didn’t
go in for that sort of thing much.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Somehow, something Brooks said that afternoon
stirred me up all over again and set me to
thinking. Mather and I didn’t say anything as
we came out, but I knew he too was thinking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We started off on a walk, and after a while,
as we tramped along down past old John Harvard’s
statue and on past the gymnasium, he threw back
his head and, clapping me on the shoulder, burst
out, ‘I say, old fellow, that man is a brick!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“We turned down Craigie Street and sauntered
on. Presently John Fiske turned the corner and
nodded in a jolly way over his glasses at us. ‘Did
you know, Conro,’ asked Mather, after we had
passed out of hearing, ‘that Fiske could read fifteen
languages, and knew no end of history and
everything else, and had made his mark, before he
was as old as we are by some years?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t know it, but I hadn’t time to say
so before I looked up and saw just in front of us
the gray beard and brown eyes of the man whom
I, for one, think to be the greatest poet America
has ever had.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had just got hold of Lowell last winter.
Those lines of his which Miss Brewster quoted
to us had set me to looking him up, and I was
amazed to see how little I had known of his power.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, whether it was Miss Brewster, or Phillips
Brooks, or these men, the two best writers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>English on the continent, and the thought of what
they had made their lives mean in the world of
ideas, I don’t know, but suddenly it all came over
me, the thought of earnest lives that stood for something,
and my own confounded folly, and I broke
out for the first time: ‘I say, Mather, if a fellow
has been a deuced fool for the first twenty-two
years of his life, what is he likely to be at the end
of the next twenty-two?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mather evidently didn’t think that was a
question which required an answer, and we tramped
along together in silence for a while longer. Then
he began, ‘Conro, didn’t what Brooks said to-day
make you think of that night last winter when
that black-eyed girl over there at Louisburg Square
just laid us fellows out?</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Gracious! how she did seem to take it all to
heart, as if we had committed the unpardonable sin,
as Gordon said. Whew!—didn’t it make him
mad, though?—but—well—somehow I don’t
know but she was more than half right after all.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Some things she said have been running
through my head lately: “Never a time or place
where heart and brains and hands could find such
work to do and reap such far-reaching results....
Everything has been done for us, to be sure, but
we can’t be expected to go out of our way to see
that it is passed along.”’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Madison, that was the beginning of it
all; and then we talked, and the long and short of
it is, that Mather and I didn’t take long in coming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>to the conclusion that if a fellow ever proposed
to make anything of himself, twenty-two or three
wasn’t any too early to begin to think about it.
We mulled over it a while, until finally we struck
on a scheme.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mather’s mother had come from the South,
and he had some far-away cousins there who had
been the hottest kind of rebs. Perhaps that was
what suggested it to us; but at any rate we are in
for it now, and have given each other our word of
honor to stick to it for three years at least, and
then—well, we shall see.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had two millions and he eight hundred thousand.
I have no family, you know, and he has
only married brothers and sisters; so we are free on
that score; and we have decided to put half of our
fortunes into buying up enough stock in a lot of
Southern papers to give us practical control of the
country papers over a large area down here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He writes from some little town in Alabama,”
said Mildred in parenthesis. Then she continued:</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have brought with us five or six bright
Harvard boys whom we know, and whom we are
going to work in as editors of dailies in strategic
places. Each fellow will also have general supervision
of a dozen small weekly papers scattered
through the states here.</p>

<p class='c010'>“These papers form almost the sole outlook upon
the world’s affairs which the people down here ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>get, and, with the exception of the locals with which
they are padded, are about as useful as Rollins’
Ancient History.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mather and I are hard at work studying local
history and politics and prejudices, and are planning
some of the tallest kinds of innovations. We
haven’t shown our hand yet, of course, and it is
generally understood that we are here to invest in
land.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course we shan’t make a cent out of it all—too
many niggers, and the whites are frightfully
poor—can’t pay for and don’t want anything
better than they have; but, by Jove, if I don’t
succeed in shaking up some of these consummate
old Bourbons down here by the end of the next
three years, then my name isn’t Edwin G. Conro!—that’s
all. However, they aren’t all such a bad
lot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Mildred, as she skimmed through
the last page in silence and slowly returned the
letter to the envelope, “whether these aspiring
youths succeed in bringing the millennium down
there by the time they are twenty-five remains to
be seen, but at all events they will learn some
things Harvard College has not yet taught them,
and whether they help those people much or not
they have taken the first step to save themselves.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Mildred Brewster Everett, do you mean
to say that you, a woman worth your tens of millions,
are going to come down to living again in a
brick block with little narrow rooms? Are you
going to give up the splendid library, the gallery
of rare paintings, the grand music-room, the conservatories
and stables, and all the lovely things
that you had planned?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mildred dropped her wax and seal, and turned
from her writing-desk with a gesture of mock
despair, as I continued, somewhat vehemently and
without pausing for a reply:—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you forgotten all those magnificent halls,
those terra-cottas and mosaic floors and glorious
painted windows? Think of the many times that
we have planned it all out, the baronial fireplaces
with the spreading elk antlers overhead, and the
big tiger-skin rugs; and then the cosy, cushioned
window-seats and quaintly carved lattices, the great
organ with golden pipes, and the high, wind-swept
turrets with winding stairs!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Last spring you were planning to bring all
this about when the tenement houses and more
necessary things should be under way, and now,”
I continued crossly, “to think of your fancying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>that you are too poor to build a beautiful house
for yourself, when you have money enough to buy
houses for every one else!”</p>

<p class='c005'>I think that Mildred had a passion for noble
architecture. Her keen eyes would detect beauties
or incongruities where my untrained sight perceived
nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If a man writes a bad poem, I am not compelled
to read it; if he paints a bad picture, I need
not see it more than once,” she was wont to say;
“but if he erects an ugly building in my city he
hurts me every time I walk the street, and I am
helpless.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“When constructive beauty costs no more than
this fantastic ugliness, why must such an absurdity
be inflicted upon a long-suffering public?” she
once asked in despair, as we were contemplating
an expensive monument to architectural stupidity.
And she never tempered her scorn when railing at
the angular, parti-colored houses, run mad in the
direction of ostentatious eccentricities, which are
fast displacing the simple white dwellings with
green blinds that, as she once declared, “at least
have the merit of being modest and wholesome,
and do not outrage all one’s sense of the fitness of
things.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wait until I build my house; then you shall
see,” she would exclaim, with a decided little nod
which carried the conviction, to one listener at
least, that she would some time show what money
and brains combined could do towards creating an
ideal home.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Many an hour, when driving about together, we
had amused ourselves, in the intervals of serious
work, in planning the charming mansion which she
would build, and she had entered into it all with
great zest.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My idea of a house,” she had said, “is to have
it even more beautiful without than within, so that
every line may be a positive delight to the many
who can never look within its doors. Think what
a boon to the thousands who never step inside a
church are those Back Bay towers and steeples
which I used to see from my attic window on the
hill.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A poor man has no money for a concert of
good music; he has no time for a visit to an art
museum to see a good picture or statue, or to go
to a library to read a great poem; but in sunlight
and in moonlight, seven days in the week, as he
looks from his window or passes to his work, the
beauty wrought in stone is his; it costs him neither
time nor money, and consciously or unconsciously
it appeals to him. His life is larger and richer
for it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A walk across the Public Garden on a winter
afternoon, with that campanile and the spires near
it looming large and dark against the crimson
glow in the west, has made me fresh and strong
after many a tired day,” she used to say.</p>

<p class='c005'>So it was settled that when the walls of the
House Beautiful should be reared, the first thought
should be, not for its inmates, but for the countless
unknown passers-by.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Then the next requirement was that it should
have ample room for the many guests whom its
hospitable mistress would always have around her.
There was to be air and sunshine everywhere, and
nothing too fine for constant use.</p>

<p class='c005'>Unlike most women, Mildred had little fancy
for beauty of the fragile sort. Exquisitely painted
sèvres which a careless touch might shiver to
atoms; cobweb lace that had cost the eyesight and
health of other women; tapestry which had swallowed
up years of another’s life, only to be inferior
to a painting, and become food for moths,—all
this she obstinately refused to have.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I want beautiful things about me,” she said;
“but beauty that is so perishable as to be a constant
care to the owner, or else to entail an army
of servants, is a luxury which I think no rational
being can afford. I shall have everything rich and
strong and yet simple; there shall be no satin,
gilded-legged chairs, no elaborate dust-catching
carvings; no draperies and carpets that cannot
bear the sun; but there shall be noble statues,
pictures by great masters, luxurious rugs and
divans, glorious color from jewelled windows and
precious, many-hued marbles. I do not want a
palace with dreary suites of high-studded rooms
and frescoed ceilings, and I do not want a house
that is nothing but a crowded museum of bric-à-brac,
like so many I see. No; my house shall be
a stately mansion with far-seeing towers and turrets,
with cosy, low-studded rooms and wainscoted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>walls, with pillared arcades and richly carved stone
balconies. All Spain and Venice and Nuremberg
shall be studied for hints of beauty, and it shall
be a home, a perfectly ideal American home; beautiful
without and within; built to stand while generations
come and go, graced by children, pets, and
flowers, and the charming society of noble men
and women.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Where this home was to be built had not yet been
decided. Sometimes Mildred would in imagination
place it on some smooth, green slope on the banks
of the Hudson; sometimes among the elms on some
hilltop overlooking the golden dome on Beacon
Hill, with a glimpse of blue sea and white sails on
the far horizon beyond.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course I was to have the fun of helping to
plan about it all, and Mildred was to bring home
hosts of treasures from Europe after her sojourn
abroad. But now, this morning, all this dream of
the beauty that was to be had been ended by what
Mildred had been saying.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have settled one hundred thousand dollars
on Ralph,” she had said, “for his own personal
use. He would not accept any more, and I have
decided to set apart for myself the same sum. The
interest on two hundred thousand dollars ought, I
think, to provide all the travel and luxuries that
two reasonable mortals need; and the rest of the
money which I had at first thought of spending on
myself we are going to devote to several things,
rather better worth doing than building a house,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>which not one in a hundred thousand could afford
to maintain after we have gone.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Mildred,” I expostulated, “you have always
asserted that it was right to encourage art;
that it was folly to refuse to buy a picture or a
jewel just because there were still starving people
in existence somewhere. I have heard you say
repeatedly that money thus spent gave employment
to labor, encouraged art, and”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” she interrupted, “that is true in a certain
way, no doubt; but listen: I have been thinking
this over a great deal of late. Suppose now
that I spend half a million or so in employing a
certain number of people to make and furnish a
magnificent house. Grant that it is a real work
of art, and will be a thing of beauty and a joy
forever. My husband and a score of friends and
I enjoy it; the workmen are paid; ‘art is encouraged.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now suppose again that, instead of erecting an
expensively beautiful house for myself, I employ
the same number of people to provide a beautiful
building which shall be for the use, in the course
of its existence, of scores of thousands whose eyes
are inured to ugliness and into whose lives a bit of
beauty rarely comes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suppose that the spacious marble staircases,
the tiles and wood carvings and painted windows,
are put where they shall awaken the imagination
and delight the soul of tired mothers and little
children who have known nothing beyond their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>narrow alley and grimy chimney-pots; of girls who
stand all day before a machine, or over a hot
stove, and who spend their money for the bits of
tawdry finery which are the nearest approach to
beauty that their means can compass? Which
building would encourage art the most, think you?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, Ruby,” said Mildred, wheeling around
from her desk, while I stood opposing to her ardor
a face of grim discontent; “do you fancy that I
could sit in my great, palatial house, remembering
the sights that I have seen this year in the one-roomed
sod houses on bleak Western prairies, in
the dingy, cheerless cabins of the colored people at
the South, and in the vile-smelling tenements of
this great city, and satisfy my soul by saying that
I gave employment to the men who did this work
for me?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Could I honestly call myself in any sense a follower
of Him who had not where to lay his head,
and know that this wealth of beauty was kept for
me and a dozen or so cultivated people who need
it scarcely more than I, while a thousand beauty-loving
natures were starving who might be fed by
my superabundance?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mildred, you are positively morbid,” I exclaimed,
thoroughly vexed. “To be sure, no one
has a right to be selfish, to think of himself first,—but
that you have not done. You planned your
house in the beginning for the pleasure of others
far more than for yourself. You meant to make
your home a perfect retreat for all the poor artists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>and students and broken-down teachers that it
could hold, and I say you are making a great mistake
if you think that you are going to serve humanity
better by building a big art museum down
at the Mulberry Bend for the benefit of the ragpickers
and stevedores, than by giving the hospitality
of such a home as yours would be to those to
whom it would be a rest and an inspiration.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mildred laughed heartily as I paused, and dropping
upon the hassock beside me, she drew me
close to her, while I prepared to renew my expostulations.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not so fast, my dear,” she said, forestalling
me. “Pray don’t imagine that I am bereft of my
senses, and propose to reform the slums by giving
them free access to a gallery of casts from the
antique. It would require a small army of policemen
and scrubbing-women to preserve it in decent
condition, if the rabble were admitted indiscriminately,
and I do not propose to give people that
form of beauty which they do not want and could
not possibly appreciate.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you blame all the rich, who, no matter
how much they may give away, still reserve enough
to buy steam yachts and build fine houses and
indulge their æsthetic tastes to the extent of one
thirtieth of their fortune,” I said pettishly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” said Mildred, slowly; “I do not blame
them. I am not their judge. I cannot speak for
others: it is right, more than that, it is necessary,
that man should create beauty, for he cannot live
by bread alone.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>“But I cannot help feeling that the beauty
should be for all; should be where all may see and
enjoy it. The old Greeks were right about that,
when the temples, the agora, the gymnasia were
consecrated to beauty, and it was the glory of the
rich to minister to the state and not spend lavish
sums in collecting private treasures.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, dear. Once I thought to have all that was
rich and fine, and that could delight the eye,
around me in my own home. I felt that I had a
right to it, provided that I thought of others first
and most. But now I see things differently. I
wonder that I ever could have been so selfish.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, Ruby,” she added, almost sternly, as she
saw my look of protest, “it was selfishness. I
meant, in spite of all my giving, to sacrifice nothing.
But I have been trying these last few months,—yes,
since that time last summer when my power
to make life better for others seemed about to be
forever taken from me,—I have been trying, and
Ralph has helped me, oh, so much, to look at all
this short life of ours in its beginning here on this
little planet, as I shall look back upon it with the
eyes of eternity, when it has all gone into the irrevocable
past. How will it seem then, little sister,
when all our foolish ambitions and traditions and
false social standards have been swept away?
Shall I be glad or sorry then, do you think, to remember
that the one talent which was placed in
my hands was used to its utmost, that nothing
was withheld but what was needed to make me the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>better fitted for my work? Ah, when my naked
soul shall stand before the judgment bar of its own
conscience and the moral law, and hears the sentence,
‘This ought ye to have done, and not to
have left the other undone,’ what shall I plead in
excuse?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mildred’s voice had sunk almost to a whisper,
and her eyes were filled with unshed tears. We
did not speak for a few moments. I felt a lump
rising in my throat and could only choke it down
while I stroked the dear head that lay warm
against my arm. My foolish questionings were
stilled. The clear insight of this simple, true-hearted
woman had pierced through and through
my flimsy protests, and I sat awed and abashed.
Presently she went on in her natural, common-sense
way to explain more definitely what she
meant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean to make a little more beauty in this
world, if I can,” she said, “and accomplish some
more important things as well; but the art of all
arts which I shall try to learn and teach is the one
which we Americans most need to study, the art
of simple living.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall have the pictures and the books, the
statues and the music that I love; but what matters
it whether they are all in my own home or
not, or whether or not I seek them in galleries
open to all alike? Not until our glaring, stony
streets are made less dreary by more trees and
fountains and statues, not until there is a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>beauty for every one, can I claim the moral right to
spend a fortune on Meissoniers or ancient Satsuma,
for my own private delight.</p>

<p class='c005'>“For a long time I have been thinking of what
could bring the greatest stimulus and joy into the
lives of the wretched poor in our great city; the
washerwomen and truckmen and foul-mouthed,
dirty little street <i><span lang="fr">gamins</span></i> whose highest bliss is
reached with the attainment of a full stomach and
the sight of a street fight or a circus procession.
It would be folly to give them money outright; but
here in amusements, just as I have found it in
regard to tenement houses and everything else,
coöperation is the key to success.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The gift of a Peabody Museum or a Hemenway
Gymnasium does not offend the pride or help
to pauperize the Harvard student, nor do the
Lowell lectures make the most cultivated people of
Boston count themselves recipients of charity when
they crowd the hall to hear Professor Morse talk
about Japanese pottery, or the Englishman Haweis
discourse on music. Money given like that, in a
large way, in the enjoyment of which all unite,
never does the harm that the gift to the individual
would surely do.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, I propose to set up a counter-attraction
to the delights of the saloon and the dance-hall and
the street; and I shall put it right where it is most
needed. There shall be one substantial, clean,
beautiful building, a beacon light of beauty and
delight in a square mile of dinginess and discomfort.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>“It shall be of brick, and I shall enjoin upon
my architect to show what beautiful lines and
arches can be wrought in simple material. In a
street of ugly straight lines and right angles, this
shall stand as an object-lesson in the power of
creating perpetual pleasure to the eye by such
simple devices as the substitution of the curve for
the straight line over door and window.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then within there shall be a dozen immense
rooms connected by folding-doors, with sand heaps
and swings and blocks for the delight of the gutter
child, too old to be in the cradle and too young to
be in school. From morning until night, if he behaves
himself, he shall be sheltered and warm and
happy under the charge of some good woman. At
night these rooms shall be filled with older boys
and girls learning the use of tools, sawing, planing,
hammering, and finding it better fun to vent
their energies in manufacturing something which
they can take home for their own use than in
playing tag around the ash-barrels on the corner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What, would you have boys and girls together?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly,” said Mildred; “they would be together
on the street, and why not here?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But what is the use of a girl learning carpentering?”
I asked. “I should think she might
much better learn sewing. Besides, girls can’t do
it, and I don’t believe they would like to, if they
could.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In regard to that, you don’t know those girls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>so well as I do. They will sit by a smoky lamp in
a close room and grow round-shouldered and near-sighted
in crocheting edging and working blue
cats on cardboard; but as to plain sewing, they
think it a bore. After a day at school or in the
shop they don’t want to sit demurely on a bench
and ‘backstitch’ and sew ‘over and over.’ Then,
too, a course in carpentry would do more for
them physically than a course at the gymnasium.
There is no danger that city girls will not walk
enough at all times; what they lack is development
of arms and chest. Moreover, this is not an experiment.
I once visited a summer class in carpentering
for girls at the Tennyson Street school in
Boston, and I can assure you I haven’t forgotten
the neat book-racks and little tables those girls of
fourteen were making for themselves, nor the good
time they were having in doing it, either. Such
muscle as they were developing! However, there
can be cooking classes and sewing classes too, if
they want them, though my House Beautiful is not
to be primarily a manual training school. The
city may provide that for the child; but I want to
do what it cannot do, and that is to give innocent
amusement and a bit of beauty to lives that know
nothing of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So above these rooms is to be a great auditorium
arranged like an amphitheatre, and capable
of seating comfortably three thousand people.
There shall be no cushions, and no need of them,
for every seat shall be planned with reference to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>the human figure, and will require no padding to
insure absolute comfort.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There shall be a golden-piped organ and
‘storied windows richly dight,’ not casting a ‘dim
religious light,’ but shedding warm, rich color upon
the thousand shabby coats and shawls gathered
from the alleys and street corners of a Sunday
afternoon. Every night in the week, and all day
on Sunday, this is to be opened free to every man
or woman who wants to sit in a comfortable seat,
see interesting pictures, hear sweet music, and give
tired nerves and body a respite from the noise and
confusion of the tenement and street.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what do you propose to give them,—symphony
concerts, or Stoddard lectures?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Neither,” answered Mildred calmly, ignoring
my attempt at sarcasm, “though you have touched
my idea. I mean to give them something as nearly
like it as possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There shall be simple talks on every conceivable
subject that could interest them which admits
of illustration by the stereopticon. By the aid of
great pictures thrown upon the screen they shall
travel over land and sea. Then there shall be
story nights, when a clear-voiced student from the
school of oratory will read stories to them. Think
what it would be to these men and women, half of
whom cannot read or write, to whose minds the
facts of history and geography have no meaning,
whose knowledge of life is limited to a little village
in the Old Country, a steerage passage, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>crowded slums of New York; think what it would
be to them to step from the cold and dinginess
without into a brilliant, beautiful hall, with warmth
and light and comfort insured for one hour at least
out of the twenty-four; and then to sit and listen
to the charming story of Little Lord Fauntleroy,
or Robinson Crusoe, or to thrilling stories of exploration
and adventures.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The story or lecture shall last no more than
an hour, as their attention must be held, so that
they will want to come again. Then those who
have heard enough may go, if they wish, and make
room for others to come in to listen to a half-hour
concert. There will be no Brahm’s symphonies,
but there will be cornet solos of such classics as
the ‘Swanee River,’ and ‘Home! Sweet Home!’
and a select orchestra of half a dozen pieces will
render Strauss waltzes, airs from ‘Pinafore,’ and
the like.</p>

<p class='c005'>“On Sunday, all day long, there shall be services
of song led by the great organ and a trained
chorus. Not oratorio music, though a Handel
Largo or a ‘Lift Thine Eyes’ might sometimes be
ventured on; but simple devout church music, in
which all who can may join.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course no preaching would be advisable,
else the priests would rapidly diminish the audience;
but all the power of music shall be brought
to bear to uplift and beautify these poor, pinched
lives and bring a glimpse of sweetness and light
into the prosaic details of their daily struggle for
existence.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>“The Romish church has always been wise
enough to see the power of music in swaying the
emotions of the masses. It is time that we learned
a lesson from it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What shall you do with your other rooms on
Sunday? Shall you let them be vacant or permit
the carpentering by the boys to go on below, while
their elders are hearing the music in the great
hall above?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Neither,” answered Mildred.  The rooms shall
all be open, but not for work. The tables and
tools will have disappeared, and settees will take
their places. In one room will be perhaps a debating
club of young men, discussing the last strike,
and finding this a pleasanter place to meet for that
purpose than the street corner or the saloon. In the
next room will be a set of children clustered around
a young lady who comes down from Fifth Avenue
and gives her Sunday evenings regularly to telling
stories to them. She is not a creature of my imagination,
either, Ruby. Last week I met her at
a friend’s house. She came in flushed and radiant
from an hour’s romp with the children in the nursery.
‘I believe my one talent must be story-telling,’
she said, as the children appeared on the
scene clamoring after her; and her mother fondly
said, ‘Ah, there are no stories like sister Helen’s,
all the children think.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘So,’ I thought, ‘that is just the girl I want.
Her talent shall find a larger field for development;
she shall tell stories to forty children instead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>of four.’ I told her my plan, and she almost cried
with delight. ‘Oh, Mrs. Everett, do you really
think that I could do any good in that way? I
never dreamed of it, and I should be so glad. I’ve
always felt as if I wanted to do something, but
mamma won’t let me visit in the Charities. She
says I am too young. My eyes won’t admit of my
reading to the blind or sewing for the poor, and
I began to think there wasn’t anything that I
could do.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I tell you, Ruby, I am finding every day dozens
of girls like her, who are only waiting for some
one to say, ‘This is what you can do; here is your
work; here is the place; and here are the ones
who need you.’ I am beginning to learn that the
putting of the right person in the right place is
the main thing, after all. The best thing that my
money can do is to make it possible for those who
can give, to find those who need just what they can
give.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall find not only one charming story-teller,
but a score, who will meet their circles of little
street Arabs week after week and month after
month, and if they are half as pretty and entertaining
as the girl I know, you may rest assured those
youngsters will count it a privilege to come.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not every one will be admitted; a clean face
and hands and good behavior will be the prerequisite
for retaining the ticket of membership to
all the classes. Then in another room will be a class
of young people listening to an emergency lecture,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>given by some bright, young medical student, who
will arouse their interest by objective illustrations,
such as the bandaging of sham wounds and the
resuscitating of a person supposed to be drowned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In still another room, perhaps, some one will
be reading the newspapers aloud to a score of men
who are enjoying their pipes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All the rooms will be filled with men, women,
and children, from nine o’clock in the morning
until ten at night; one set coming as another goes;
and each having one hour at least, in the day of
rest, which shall open to him a little larger outlook
on life, and shall give him something to look forward
to through the six days of drudgery.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course all this will require a system and a
plan; but I shall have as few officials and as few
restraints as possible. A neat, white-capped woman,
with her badge of authority, will, I think,
be quite as efficient as a big policeman; for any
unseemly behavior will result in the immediate
surrender of the numbered metal check which will
serve as a card of entrance; and when admission
is recognized as a privilege it will be coveted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No one will stay away because he is too shabby
to come, and no one will be made to feel that he
has no right or share in it all; but every week
twenty-five thousand men, women, and children
shall have one or two hours of peace and happiness
offered them, just because,—think of it,
Ruby,—just because I did not build the House
Beautiful for myself.”</p>

      <div class='line'>“And whether we shall meet again I know not,</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore our everlasting farewell take.”</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The days sped away all too fast, crowded full
of work and talk and earnest thought. I entered
eagerly into all of Mildred’s plans; she always
knew that she could rely on me to do that, in spite
of the protestations and objections with which I
generally greeted the first announcement of each
new scheme. I think she rather liked my objecting,
as it gave her so fine an opportunity to state
her case clearly and triumph over all obstacles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do be charitable and indulge my garrulous
propensities a little,” she would laughingly plead.
“You may congratulate yourself that I was not
born a man,—such a stump orator as I should
have made, with all my hobbies!”</p>

<p class='c005'>In spite of her gayety and happiness, however, I
could see that the strain of attending to multitudes
of things was beginning to tell, even on her apparently
boundless strength. The day before the
last she was with her lawyers, signing last papers,
seeing that nothing was neglected, no one forgotten.
In the evening there was a farewell reception for
hosts of friends, at which all good-byes were said.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>“I want no one but you to see me sail, Ruby
dear,” she said; and so the hour of her departure
was not announced. They had planned, first of all,
a sailing voyage to the West Indies, and thence
they were to go to Spain.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can’t bear Europe just yet,” said Mildred.
“I want to put letters, despatches, and newspapers
even, out of reach for a few weeks; to forget immigrants,
cooking schools, tenement houses, libraries,
and lawyers, and all the several problems that have
been besetting me these last bewilderingly busy
months.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I must get time to stop and think. I want to
sail idly through purple tropic seas; to skirt the
green shores of volcanic islands; I want to feel for
the time being that I have banished conscience and
responsibility; in fact,” she added, laughing, “I
want to become a pagan for a while, if I can.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The most sensible thing that I ever heard you
say,” I remarked with decision. “If there ever
was a girl who has earned a vacation, it is you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They were going on the Nanepashemet, manned
by Captain Roberts, a weather-beaten seaman of
Marblehead, who twenty years ago had dandled
the little Mildred on his knee. He now counted
it the greatest honor of his life that she had not
forgotten him, and that he had been invited to take
this bonny bride on his plain little sailing vessel.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, jest think of it, Miss,” he proudly remarked
to me, “she might jest as easy hev bought
one of them crack steam yachts with fancy fixins,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>and have gone in reg’lar Vanderbilt style. But
it’s jest like her, jest like her. She wa’n’t never
one of the kind to make a splurge. I knew when
she got her money ’twouldn’t turn her head.”</p>

<p class='c005'>One day Ralph and I had been down to inspect
the craft and attend to certain alterations in the
cabin which were to be made for the accommodation
of the two passengers, when the captain grew
quite communicative on his favorite theme.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knew that little chick ’ud make something
when she wa’n’t no higher than that,” he remarked,
holding his brown, tattooed hand about
three feet above the deck.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I didn’t cal’late on her turnin’ out so mighty
rich, of course,” he continued, meditatively, leaning
against the rail and evidently pleased to find
an appreciative listener, “but I allus knew, by the
way the little thing kep’ askin’ questions about
everything under heaven, that she’d got a headpiece
on her that ’ud make things spin one o’ these
days. Full o’ fun, too. She could swim like a
duck, and row a boat with them little pipe-stem
arms of hers, and yet—wal—she was sort o’
pious-like too, and allus askin’ me to tell her about
my trips to the East Injies, and whether I see any
women a-throwin’ their babies to crocodiles and
a-bowin’ down to idols of wood and stone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘I tell you, Cap’n Roberts,’ that little thing ’ud
say, a-settin’ there in my boat, when her ma let
me take her out,—‘I tell you, when I get to be a
grown-up woman I’m goin’ out there and just
teach those people better.’</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>“‘Did you ever hear about Judson?’ says she.
‘No,’ says I; ‘was he a sea-cap’n?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘He was a missionary,’ says she, real solemn;
‘a missionary; and that’s what I’m going to be;
and you’ll take me out there in your ship, won’t
you, cap’n?’ says she.  ‘And oh, I’m goin’ to take
a whole trunk full of story-books for all those poor
little girls that have to get married and don’t have
any.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wal, wal,” he continued, as he filled his pipe,
“she begun it young, ’n I warn’t a mite surprised
when I heerd she’d got her money and see what
she was a-beginnin’ to do for those nasty Italians
down to the Mulberry Bend. She never forgits
anybody, Millie don’t. Excuse me, I s’pose I orter
say Mis’ Everett now. She’s been a-talkin’ to me
about the sailors; says when we git out to sea she
wants a long talk with me about ’em; wants to
know what they read, and everything of that sort.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And that is the way she proposes to turn
pagan,” I soliloquized.</p>

<p class='c005'>The last day had come, and we were on board
the ship. Mildred, in her long, gray ulster and
bright steamer hood, paced the deck arm in arm
with me, taking her last look at the bridge, the
towers and spires, the bronze goddess looming up
against the blue, and all the dear, familiar sights.
The sky was cloudless; the soft south-wind gently
swelled the white sails overhead; the sea, the fawning,
treacherous sea, shone brilliantly in the golden
sunlight and seemed to murmur caressingly in our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>ears, as if to beguile us to forget its cruel power
hidden for the time under this shining mask.</p>

<p class='c005'>We paced up and down in silence, breaking it
now and then by trying to say the last words,
which were so hard to speak. Ralph had kindly
gone below, ostensibly to look after a hamper of
fruit. There was a lump in my throat; I could
not speak.</p>

<p class='c005'>How was it that this woman, whom I had met
but little more than a year ago, had come to be
nearer to me than any kith or kin? Life had
broadened, had grown rich, since her life had come
into mine. In my little narrow routine, fashioned
according to the demands of society and its conventionalities,
I had never before dreamed of its
possibilities.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mildred tried to talk, but I could not answer.
At last, breaking down completely, I sobbed out,
“Oh, Mildred, Mildred, I <em>cannot</em> let you go. I
have no one in the wide world but you. You will
never, never come back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I had meant to be brave and not to sadden these
last moments by my selfish grief, but a sudden
premonition of evil had taken hold of me. I was
not superstitious, but I felt a convulsive clutch at
my heart as I looked up into her beautiful dark
eyes through the mist in my own.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t be morbid, darling,” said she, trying to
speak cheerfully, and drawing my arm closer in her
embrace. But her voice sounded to me strange
and far away.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>“There are few women ever blessed with such a
sister as you have been to me,” she said tenderly.
“You alone among women have made me feel this
last year that you loved me for myself, and would
have loved me just the same were I the lonely
teacher among my books instead of a favored,
flattered, rich woman. Others have given me adulation,
you have given me love. And now, dear,
that you may know that I know how real a sister
you have been to me, until we meet again wear this
for me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I saw the red gleam of the rare jewel in her
white hand, as over my finger, held in her own
warm grasp, she slipped the ruby ring, her dead
sister’s ring which I had always seen her wear.</p>

<p class='c005'>I said no word of thanks. I scarcely realized
what she had done. I was dumb with the misery
of those moments—a death’s-knell seemed sounding
in my ears.</p>

<p class='c005'>We paced on again in silence, letting the precious
moments pass. Presently she said, as if in
reply to the wild outburst of emotion which had
passed and left me numb and speechless, “Yes,
dear, it may be as you fear. Whether we meet
again, God only knows. But whether it be you or
I that goes first into the great wonderful Beyond,
of which we have so often talked, I think we shall
not be sorry, we shall not be afraid.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘For from the things we see</div>
      <div class='line'>We trust the things to be,</div>
      <div class='line'>That in the paths untrod,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>And the long days of God,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our feet shall still be led,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our hearts be comforted.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“But life is sweet, oh, so sweet. I want to live,
there is so much to do,” said Mildred earnestly.
Yet in a moment she added, hastily, “But what
folly for me to fancy that <em>I</em> am needed to do the
work.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Others shall sing the song,</div>
      <div class='line'>Others shall right the wrong,</div>
      <div class='line'>Finish what I begin,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all I fail of, win.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>We said no more, but still paced the deck together,
looking at sea and shore and sunny sky,
finding no words to tell of all that was in our
hearts.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last the signal was given, and the tug that
was to carry me back to the city steamed alongside.
I knew that the moment of parting had
come, and, like an exile summoning all his fortitude
to help him take bravely the last step across the
border line which divides him from home and
country, I said, calmly, “Well, dear,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;</div>
      <div class='line'>If not, why, then, this parting were well made.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I felt her warm, red lips against my cheek. I
heard Ralph’s strong “God bless and keep you,
little sister,” and then, almost before I knew it, I
had slipped over the vessel’s side, and they were
gone.  I saw them wave a last adieu. I saw, as
in a dream, the white-winged ship, bearing its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>precious freight, sail out into the dazzling east, over
the dimpling sea, the shimmering, golden sea, the
cruel, cruel sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no more to tell. The world knows the
rest. Seven days of calm weather, and then from
the coral reefs of the southern sea to the rocky
headlands of the north, the storm-king raged.
Madly the fierce Atlantic lashed its waves on cliff
and beach and sunken ledge, sending dumb terror
to the hearts that had seen their loved ones go
down unto the sea in ships.</p>

<p class='c005'>Somewhere on that wild waste of waters, whether
in the chill, gray dawn or in midnight blackness,
amid the lightning’s flash and thunder’s peal,—God
only knows,—a little ship went down. And
when the sharp, swift summons came, two brave
hearts went forth together into the great Unseen,
knowing of a surety that this, thank God, was not
the end—only the end of the beginning.</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
